 ",Rework the sizing styles of the URL bar for more practical button overflow,"From bug 1370401 comment 64 (edited to make sense without context):

Here's the situation now that we have overflow: -moz-hidden-unscrollable on the urlbar.

- The page action buttons no longer overlap other toolbar buttons, so this bug is less urgent.
- They still do overflow, which is not a concern to me since all of them are always accessible from the page action menu. However, the page action button can also overflow if the window/urlbar gets small enough, which is a bit bad.

I still think we should get rid of min-width: 1px on the URL bar, which will prevent the URL bar from overflowing at all. It will result in the code that overflows toolbar buttons working more accurately, which is very beneficial for realistic window sizes. Toolbar buttons can overflow before the EV label is truncated, which I think is a good thing, especially if the user has a lot of toolbar buttons.

I also think that setting a min-width on the actual text in the URL bar is definitely something we should do. Also, I've filed bug 1401835 to consider intelligently hiding page action buttons when space is limited.

We should attempt this alongside bug 1401835, and moreover, I think it might end up being a prerequisite to being able to implement that one. Here are some decisions that I can predict we'll need to make:

- If we start intelligently collapsing page action buttons, when is the right time to start doing this? Should we hide toolbar buttons first, or page action buttons? I think the answer is to not touch the toolbar button overflow code, and to start collapsing page action buttons when the URL text width gets small; i.e., keep as much as the URL visible for as long as possible as the URL bar gets smaller.

- Can we land the removal of the min-width before worrying about page action buttons? I think we can and should, especially because dogfooding this might help understand the best way to implement page action button collapsing. I also expect this will end up being a prerequisite like I mentioned above.

I've tried to be as clear as I can articulating all of this, but I might have to read this again later and make amendments :)"

Actual results:

Hypothesis?? Given that 1Password is filling in form elements *and* triggering an animation, it seems almost guaranteed that it is accessing DOM elements from the chrome process.  This has obvious conflicts with e10s.  I'm guessing that the 1P developers just need to adjust their addon to compensate for this, but I thought I would file the bug anyway.

 ",Launcher process improvements for automation and UAC-disabled configurations,"There are a couple of cases that we need to handle for automation and general correctness. Since they are closely intermingled, I'm going to land this stuff in one bug.

1) The firefox process launched by automation is assumed to stay alive for the lifetime of the browsing session. I'm adding a command-line option that makes this happen, as well as an environment variable check (so that hopefully we don't need to go around modifying test harnesses all over the place).

2) I'm going to add a command-line option to prevent the launcher de-elevating the browser. Again, this is in case of potential automation issues.

3) If UAC is disabled and we're started at high integrity, I think that the current elevation code will cause an infinite loop -- the launcher will continuously restart itself using explorer, but explorer will never be a medium integrity user.

To fix this, I'm going to use a combination of TokenElevationType and TokenIntegrityLevel queries on the current token to determine UAC and integrity level.

If the token elevation type is TokenElevationTypeDefault, then UAC is disabled and we need to fall back to checking our integrity level.

Note that if we don't have UAC, the only way that we can drop our integrity level is by duplicating our token and dropping the IL there, then calling CreateProcessAsUser. We also need to use this method if the --wait-for-browser is specified, since we don't get a child process handle out of the remote ShellExecute call made via Explorer."

"Extension Compatibility
 ",Investigate if RESTRequest may do bad things with utf-8 in edge-cases.,"Currently RESTRequest is implemented with a nsIStreamListener, and in the OnDataAvailable method we create a nsIConverterInputStream to decode the received chunk as utf-8. However, there seems a risk that the chunk fed to onDataAvailable splits a valid utf-8 sequence, causing some level of data corruption.

The 2 choices we seem to have are:

* work out how to use a single nsIConverterInputStream across all onDataAvailable calls - however, this relies on 2 assumptions: (1) that the stream implementation leaves behind not-yet-valid utf-8 chars ready for the next chunk and (2) that the same |stream| arg is passed to onDataAvailable on each call. (2) in particular seems unsafe to rely on.

* Buffer the bytes and do the encode when we know the stream has been consumed.

Given that (IIUC) no consumers of RESTRequest attempt to use the data as it streams in, the second option sounds slightly better (although with a slightly larger memory foot-print - there will be a brief period where both the raw stream and the decoded utf-8 are both in memory)."

Hi Guys,

my FF is crashing all over the place. It seems to happen more frequently when on www.google.com/ig but it is definately not restricted to this page (I have also tried removing and re-adding different gadgets to the page, but it didn't seem to effect it). When it crashes, I receive no error, no 'talkback' agent, nothing. And there doesnt appear to be anything in the logs. On re-opening ff, it prompts me to restore previous session, this has mixed results also (crashes on restore sometimes, not on others, I usually just start a new session as that seems to make it last longer before next crash).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Loading www.google.com/ig will sometimes make it crash.
Actual Results:  
ff just disappears. No error, nothing. Just gone.

Expected Results:

"PDF Viewer
 ",PDF Viewer should ignore fonts set by the user in Firefox Options,"It seems that the PDF viewer incorrectly takes into account the font settings in Firefox Options, so that if the user chooses to customise the fonts used for viewing web page content, those fonts are also used for displaying PDF documents.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start Firefox using a new profile
2. In Options, go to Content > Fonts & colours > Advanced and untick the ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts"" checkbox
3. Change the 'Serif' and 'Sans-serif' fonts to something non-standard, eg. Comic Sans MS
4. Open http://www.raib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/130311_B012013_Four_Lane_Ends.pdf

Expected results:

The PDF should be displayed using the correct font(s) for that document. The same as it would be when viewed in an external viewer.

Actual results:

The PDF is displayed using whatever weird and wacky font I've chosen to view web pages in.

In addition, when any user-selected font is used, certain characters in PDF documents are not displayed correctly, and are replaced by some Chinese or other random character. This seems to happen regardless of which particular font is selected.

In the linked PDF for example, all 'fi' and 'fl' characters are displayed incorrectly when the ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts"" checkbox is unticked."

 ",Retain button to re-enable TLS 1.0/1.1 via the error page in ESR 78,"The TLS 1.0/1.1 deprecation will be override-able via preference and policy for the duration of ESR 78. Given the general audience for ESR releases, I recommend we re-enable the ""fix it"" button on the ESR 78 branch. We could consider landing the removal of that button maybe halfway through the ESR 78 cycle.
This likely wouldn't have measurable impacts on old TLS usage on the Internet, but would hopefully keep users who aren't comfortable changing prefs from staying on older versions of the browser while the long-tail of enterprise and old equipment catches up.
(Of course, ESR 2021 will come for them, too.)
Since current plans involve removing the button from m-c earlier than 78, to perform this change we would need to delay unlanding the code until after ESR 78 branches, then flip the pref on the ESR-78 branch.

My previous attempts at this work kinda worked from the outside-in (eg, make processIncoming promise based and work down) which ended up needing to change the entire world. I think a better approach is inside-out (eg, making the lowest level of the call stacks promise based, hoisting promiseSpinningly calls up to the functions that remain synchronous). This has the downside of sprinkling more promiseSpinningly calls, but allows a more iterative approach.

This patch unifies AsyncResource and Resource making them exclusively promise-based. A few other simple methods also were made promise based while I was there. The patch is large, but hopefully it is fairly easy to review as most changes are somewhat mechanical."

retained, I can click OK to close.  Everything works in these cases.  It looks
specific to changing the homepage setting.  Weird.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Edit -> Preferences
2. Enter a valid URL into the Home Page text field.
3. Click OK.

Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:

Those randomly-named files also show up on the module lists, without any debug ID etc.

I found one report in bp-09e91f4c-0130-45b7-9103-e1c3d2140120 that does have a better stack and no such weird module name, but then that one is not at startup.

Hello,
For some days, firefox crashes on some particular webpages : it has begun with the 53 release, and now with the 54.
I am under the up-to-date rolling release archlinux.

Firefox crashes always on the same pages.
Sometimes that could be pages with too much ads, and I don't care too much about the crash.

But now, I cannot acces to my Yahoo-email login page :
There is no problem to access to the first step to write my email address, and then the next page is about password : I cannot write my password because the tab is not responding and crashes.

This beahavior is critical because access of emails are necessary (for now, i use another browser than FF)

[Description:]
There are cases when moving topsites around, causes the move to be made to a position incremented by the number of shown sponsored topsites(?). Also, doing it a while, it would cause bug 1673429 and additionally to create new topsites placeholders(>32+)
[Environment:]
Windows 10
83.0b5
[Preconditions:]
Position 1 and Position 2 have sponsored top sites.
Position 32 has sponsored top site.
[Steps:]

Download and install RO localized Firefox.
Create an user.js and set: browser.topsites.useRemoteSetting = true and browser.search.region to ""RO"", connecting to the staging main-preview.
Start the browser with the predefined profile.
Open a new about:preferences#home and set topsites to be shown on 4 rows.
Open a new tab.
Observe the topsites section.
Drag and drop position 32 sponsored top site to position random position.
Move a normal topsite to another position.
Redo 7. or 8. multiple times.

[Actual Result:]

Top sites are listed correctly: positions 1,2,32 have sponsored topsites
7/8. Given the preconditions, you will get the top site moved to position +2
Weird things start happening: bug 1673429, new topsites placeholders (check video_recording)

[Expected Result:]
Topsites get moved to the chosen position.
[Note:]
Please note that there is a trigger for the reported behavior, it's intermittent and not always reproducible.

As author of one of the patches included in that push, we need your help to address this regression.

This is a list of all known regressions and improvements related to the push:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perf.html#/alerts?id=1142

On the page above you can see an alert for each affected platform as well as a link to a graph showing the history of scores for this test. There is also a link to a treeherder page showing the Talos jobs in a pushlog format.

To learn more about the regressing test(s), please see:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests#tp5
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests#tp5o_scroll
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Buildbot/Talos/Tests#TART.2FCART

Reproducing and debugging the regression:

If you would like to re-run this Talos test on a potential fix, use try with the following syntax:
try: -b o -p win32,win64 -u none -t tp5o[Windows 7,Windows 8],g1-e10s[Windows 7,Windows 8],svgr-e10s[Windows 7,Windows 8] --rebuild 5  # add ""mozharness: --spsProfile"" to generate profile data

(we suggest --rebuild 5 to be more confident in the results)

To run the test locally and do a more in-depth investigation, first set up a local Talos environment:
https://wiki.mozilla.lorg/Buildbot/Talos/Running#Running_locally_-_Source_Code

Then run the following command from the directory where you set up Talos:
talos --develop -e [path]/firefox -a tp5o:tp5o_scroll:cart --e10s

Making a decision:
As the patch author we need your feedback to help us handle this regression.

"Downloads Panel
 ",[ux] Provide design spec for redesigned panel subviews,"In order to implement bug 1353360 a spec would be helpful. If there is one in the invision doc and I missed it, I apologize - please point it out to me. :-)

In particular:

- asset for the 'back' arrow on these subviews
- hover/active styling for the arrow button
- size of the arrow button and thereby minimum size for the header (actual size will depend on system font sizes and so might vary)
- some kind of styling guidance for the edge of the subview while mid-animation now that we no longer keep a dimmed bit at the side. I assume we'll want a border of some kind in order to make the background of the main and subviews not look continuous between those two parts mid-transition/animation.

Based on the mocks so far I'm assuming:

- the text in the header should be both horizontally and vertically centered
-- horizontal centering ignores the presence of the back button, ie text is centered against the left and right edges of the panel, not against the edge of the back icon or button and the edge of the panel
- text should be bold, and otherwise system foreground color
- 1px solid grey line at the bottom of the header (like existing Firefox)

If any of these assumptions are wrong or there's something else I'm missing that would be good to know."

when running with the dreaded ""ispiked"" profile, I was noticing that when ever I visited a link, a few second later, the UI would freeze for a noticable amount of time (5 - 10 seconds?)

I did some debugging, and here's what's going on.

upon visiting a page, we'll call nsNavHistoryExpire::OnAddURI()

>	places.dll!nsNavHistoryExpire::OnAddURI(__int64 aNow=1196930465625000)  Line 161	C++

that kicks of the expire timer, and when that timer fires, we will call DoPartialExpiration(), which will call ExpireItems() which will call FindVisits()

I think the query for find visits need to be tuned:

SELECT v.id, v.place_id, v.visit_date, h.url, h.favicon_id, h.hidden, b.fk FROM moz_places h LEFT OUTER JOIN moz_historyvisits v ON h.id = v.place_id LEFT OUTER JOIN moz_bookmarks b on h.id = b.fk WHERE v.visit_date < ?1 ORDER BY v.visit_date DESC LIMIT ?2"

The first is after clicking minimize memory use in the about:memory page. At this point Firefox is consuming about 3.5 GB across all processes (yes, I have a lot of tabs). The second screenshot shows the about:memory use about 10 hours later when total memory use is 5.4 GB.

Of some note is that about:newtab is consuming near 150 MB and when one of these is expanded in the tree, I see several strings of about 10 MB each which appear to be storing PNG images. That a lot of memory for a tab that isn't yet showing me anything I really care about. FWIW, I have the default new tab preferences except that I have unchecked ""Recommended by Pocket"".

I do appreciate the performance of FFQ but the benefits are negated when my box starts to swap. Yes, it's an older box but it's still a quad-core with 8 GB of RAM. Before FFQ, this set of tabs would startup with consuming about 1.2 GB on a pre-FFQ 32-bit version of Firefox and maybe work its way up to 2.5 GB across all 32-bit processes. Now it's just a total memory hog. I don't think the issue is the number of tabs per se because many of them are not clicked on during a session and not that many tabs show up in the about:memory report if I search for ""top("". So I'm looking for wasted memory and the about:newtab memory consumption seems to be one issue but I suspect there are more."

Currently, we create a transaction for each individual bookmark in the copy, and then execute those transactions.

If we create a new PlacesTransaction, e.g. InsertTree, then we can create an object tree of the items to insert, and insert them all in one go.

This allows us to use database insert optimisations of insertTree, rather than individual insert operations.

Once we can redo notifications, we'll get further gains there."

Build ID: 20180322140748

Steps to reproduce:

Install https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/flag-of-co-385587-2/

It works. Exit the browser. Run it ~24 hours later.


Actual results:

This theme doesn't get applied - Firefox starts with the default theme.

Trying to select this theme in the customizations and add-ons does _not_ work either - you select it and nothing happens.


Expected results:

A custom theme should keep on working.

The only workaround is to open add-ons, uninstall it completely, go to its home page and install it again. It will work then for a little while: launching the browser less than an hour after installing the theme doesn't break it. Run the browser several hours later  (> 8 in my case) and the theme will fail to apply.

Info: Firefox for Linux 60.0b8 (64-bit), the official build from ftp.mozilla.org.

Affected platforms

Windows 10

Steps to reproduce

Launch Firefox and access: https://whereby.com/
Start a video call.
Hover over the Firefox icon in the taskbar.
Close the window with the Global Sharing Overlay.

Expected result

The Global Sharing Overlay shouldn't be closable or there should be a way for it to be brought back up.

Actual result

The bar is closed and you can't make it appear again on the same call.

Regression range

It's a feature implementation bug.

From dbodea:

This new Global Sharing Indicator cannot be closed on MacOS and this seems to be a correct approach; It can be minimized in the dock, but not closed. Furthermore, the old Global Sharing Indicator can't be closed on Windows either, it can just be dragged on the top of the main screen.
It appears that this issue is also reproducing on Ubuntu 18.04.4LTS.
So this is an issue that occurs on both Windows and Linux OSes, but not on MacOS.
This might need a UX opinion, but the impossibility of closing the Global Sharing Overlay might be the best approach. It is how it was previously designed.

"New Tab Page
 ",New tab page has unnecessary (or marginally-necessary) vertical scrollbar at various sizes,"Starting in today's Nightly (I think), I'm seeing a vertical scrollbar much more frequently on about:newtab.

This includes cases where:
 (1) the only tiles which are out of view (and forcing the vertical scrollbar) are *empty dotted-border tiles*.  (It makes some sense that these blank tiles would appear when there's space for them, but not when there's no space.)

 (2) the only tiles which are out of view (and forcing the vertical scrollbar) are tiles that we're happy to leave un-displayed at other window-sizes.  E.g. if I make my window wide enough to show 2 tiles side-by-side, then about:newtab renders with 6 tiles (3 rows of 2), regardless of how tall the window is. But if I make my window skinnier, it only shows 3 tiles (3 rows of 1).

The presence of a scrollbar (i.e. the fact that we're showing too-many-tiles-to-fit-my-viewport) seems broken to me, in both (1) and (2), but especially (1).

I'm assuming this is a regression from bug 1180387, based on looking at recent commits that mention ""New Tab"" in their commit message."

=> The bookmarks are inserted near the paste point but are not next to each other.


This is happening due to the paste handling code being different to the drop handling code.

 ","randomly crashes with no apparent trigger, but gmail is almost always open in one of the tabs","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

Firefox crashes fairly frequently, but at seemingly random intervals.  Gmail is almost always open in one of the tabs, but it is not always the active tab.  The crash does not seem to be triggered by any sort of action on my part, because it also happens when my computer has been sitting idle.  I have themes and several lab features enabled on my gmail.  The latest Firefox update did nothing to solve the problem, as it has crashed twice in the half hour since I installed the updates.  The crash reporter files a report, but I have never received an email with further information.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have gmail open in a tab
2. Surf normally and wait
3.
Actual Results:  
Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes Firefox crashes and the Crash Reporter appears.  

Expected Results:  
It should not have crashed.

I use the ""ocean"" theme in my gmail, and have the ""superstars"" and ""forgotten attachment"" labs enabled."

After bug 1386800's patch has landed, the progressbar on the download icon now starts from the right and finishes at the left on RTL builds, but 2 issues arose that can be seen only during an (active?) download:
1. The right part of the progress bar has gotten a bit longer (and is not curvy anymore), compared to it's left side, and that's probably because of issue #2

 ",Developer Edition Mac installer has no background image,"Opening a fresh Developer Edition installer from https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/ results in a window with a plain white background (i.e. the default for .dmg images).

I'm attaching a screenshot of the behavior. Launching the Developer Edition application and going to the About window indicates 62.0b11, Aurora update channel. about:support indicates 20180723144101 as the build id; about:buildconfig indicates https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/88222b8b526d8a6a0f2e4ca099f425af17f7d10d as the hg revision.

Filing into Untriaged because I thought this should go into the Installer component, but I wasn't sure since I think that might be just for the Windows wizard application and not for the ""static"" Mac installer .dmg file."

 ",Do not create new tabs for javascript links,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E)

When selecting ""open in a new tab"" for a javascript link, Firefox goes ahead and opens a new tab, which then fails to do anything useful. Most of the time the script is just ""void()"" anyway.

While making ""open in new tab"" work for all links would be really rather neat, the current behaviour could be improved as an interim stop-gap measure.

Specifically, when selecting this action for a javascript link, the browser should just process it as if it was clicked normally, instead of creating a new tab.

Motivation: go to a javascript-heavy website (every other one these days), middle-click a few links ""to see later"", close the original page, and face a whole bunch of blank tabs. Not nice at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See Details.
Actual Results:  
Javascript links open in a new tab and fail to operate properly.

Expected Results:  
(the trickier alternative most certainly covered in a separate bug) Clone the current page and process the click there.

(the stop-gap approach to the very annoying current behaviour) Just pretend the user clicked the link normally."

Hi!

Since the end of december I noticed that Phoenix toolbars don't seem to save
changes. Whenever I customize the toolbar, it will accept the changes to the
actual window, but whenever I open a new window or close an reopen Phoenix, a
random (usually about 3) amount of toolbar elements will show up - which is not
(!) even the default set. Actually, I do not see any pattern behind what
appears, but I do got used to the back button at some times ;-)
(Just noticed: If I open new windows, they will always show the same buttons
unless I close Phoenix entirely)

Ah yes, I did install to a clean directory and I also deleted my old user-directory.

Happy debugging :-/

Jon

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Phoenix
2. customize toolbar
3a. close Phoenix
or
3b. open a new window
4a. start Phoenix

Actual Results:  
Toolbar shows random toolbar elemts (all but those selected when customizing or
those that are used by default)

Expected Results:  
Show those elements selected when customizing or shown on first launch"

 ",if a page has no title (including a redirect) we need to clear the previous title,"if a page has no title or is a redirect, we need to clear the previous title

this bug comes in a few flavors:

a)

1) page doesn't exist, so you get a 404 title (like ""www.sspitzer.org Error page"" for http://www.sspitzer.org/foobarcheese.html)
2) then, I create that page, but I don't give it a title

in moz_places, we continue to use ""www.sspitzer.org Error page"".  that will show up in in url bar autocomplete, places organizer, history sidebar, etc.

b) a site that normally redirects, like mail.polvi.net is temporarily down, so you get a 5xx message.  when it comes back, the title remains bogus (see screen shot.)"

See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1127151#c47 and https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=467617

It might be worthwhile to use D3DKMTWaitForVerticalBlankEvent[1] instead of DwmComposition since we could support Vista and from the chrome bug, it looks like it's more accurate than Dwm. A sample implementation is at [2].

This bug is to investigate replacing the current DwmFlush approach in the Windows vsync thread with D3DKMTWaitForVerticalBlankEvent.

his/her favorite sites, the next time that user fires up Phoenix, all the tabs
would load with their favorite sites. This would be a real time-saver. In
effect, you would be giving the user a user-defined portal using the tab function.

 ","""ImportEnterpriseRoots"": false does not work","The ImportEnterpriseRoots does not work as expected. According to the documentation both true and false values are allowed:

https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates#certificates

But it doesn't matter if you set ImportEnterpriseRoots to true or false. In both cases Firefox locks the pereference security.enterprise_roots.enabled to true.

Maybe it's not intended to set the value to false. I looked at the code and the code doesn't handle different values, it always set security.enterprise_roots.enabled to true when the ImportEnterpriseRoots policy is used. In this case the documentation is wrong. But I guess it makes sense to allow both values, as documented, to lock the setting.

 ","TypeError: can't redefine non-configurable property ""gEditItemOverlay"" when opening the library window on Mac (lots of menu items enabled when they should be disabled)","When opening the ""Show all bookmarks"" window on Mac, I'm currently seeing two errors:

TypeError: gBrowserInit is undefined[Learn More]  macBrowserOverlay.xul:77:43

This also leads to a lot of the menu items being enabled when they shouldn't be (e.g. View menu).

This is a regression from bug 1381853 which changed how the edit overlay item was being loaded:

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/3a5168e0b5e4


On Mac, the places.xul loads macBrowserOverlay.xul which in turn loads browser.js which defines the lazy getter.  However, places.xul is also loading editBookmarksOverlay.js which also defines its own defineLazyGetter for gEditItemOverlay.

Hence, at some stage everything blows up.

From what I can tell the only visible effects are the menu issues, and the warnings on the console."

About 3 days ago, Google Reader started running ridiculously slow with Firefox. I've tried uninstalling Google Gears and other add-ins, but nothing has sped it back up to normal. When I click on a new blog to read on the left-hand side, it takes 30-60 seconds to load the new blog, and then the titles start to appear one at a time, every 5 seconds or so. The entire page with 40+ titles used to load in about 2 seconds, and now it takes minutes!

I checked the page in IE, and it's running fine there, so it's not a problem with the Google servers, as it is unique to Firefox.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to Google Reader

I think just checking Services.prefs.prefHasUserValue(""identity.sync.tokenserver.uri"") is enough for this purpose - that will also exclude staging etc too, which I think is what we want.

Today I updated it from a 38.0 beta build (not sure which one) to 38.0.5beta1. After the update, the Pocket toolbar button was not in my toolbar by default (it does appear in the customize palette).

Build ID: 20100101

Steps to reproduce:

If a website is being visited Firefox 59 shows now a dialog and asks the user if he wants to set his preferred language to english to reduce tracking (probably privacy.resistFingerprinting needs to be set to true to make this dialog to appear). The choice for this setting gets stored into privacy.spoof_english.


Actual results:

If privacy.resistFingerprinting is now flipped back to false it will also reset privacy.spoof_english which has the negative side-effect that the user has to set this preference again (causing the dialog to appear again) after he enables privacy.resistFingerprinting again.


Expected results:

Either:
1. privacy.spoof_english has not effect if privacy.resistFingerprinting is set to false -> so there is no reason to reset it as it is likely the user wants to have its last used setting back instead of configuring it again.
or:
2. privacy.spoof_english has an effect if privacy.resistFingerprinting is set to false (currently I assume this being the unlikely case) -> there is now even more a reason to not reset it.


Additional information:

For example this has currently a negative impact on usability for me as I need to temporarily disable privacy.resistFingerprinting so that http://www.kongregate.com is able to detect the Flash Player. After the detection has occured I enable privacy.resistFingerprinting again but now I get asked again if I want to set english to my preferred language while I would prefer this selection would still have been remembered."

"Address Bar
 ",Have the client know when it needs to re-register the device due to additional fields being added.,"Periodically we will add new fields to the device registration info we send to the FxA servers. When Firefox updates to a new version, it's possible that the new version will register additional fields to support features in that version (eg, we added push support this way) - but because the client has already registered the device it doesn't know that it should re-register the device with those new fields.

The simplest approach would use some kind of versioning and cause the new registration to happen immediately after the new version starts, but this means the server is going to be under heavy load each time a new release with new fields comes out. This might be OK if we put some additional work in to ensure the ""backoff"" semantics work correctly (and relatively silently - I think currently we will write an error log) and the server team puts effort into ensuring the server sends these responses before the servers have melted.

There might be other approaches we could explore by trying to make such registration lazy or deferring the registration in a way that attempts to balance the load over time, but these seem risky - eg, it would be hard to explain that, say, push features aren't working for many people due to this, and in this example there's no obvious ""trigger"" the client can use to say ""now would be a good time to register as a push message might be coming soon"".

I think we need to get something into 48 for this, or all 47 clients who have already registered will fail to tell the server about their push endpoints as they upgrade to 48.

Thoughts?"

(`id` and `nextId` in `logins.json` are left over from the SQLite-to-JSON migration; they emulate SQLite's autoincrementing columns).

MattN says he manually edited `logins.json` some time back to fix unrelated corruption, and, given that we doesn't sync the numeric `id`, it's unlikely that Sync caused this.

 ",Recent uptick in errors for security-state/intermediates,":mostlygeek reported an uptick in remote-settings errors starting on the night of 6/10. This seems to mostly be concentrated in the security-state bucket. If you have Datadog access, you can see it at https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/piq-rtw-fk9?screenId=piq-rtw-fk9&from_ts=1559694939993&live=true&tile_size=m&to_ts=1560299739993&tpl_var_source_subtype=intermediates&tpl_var_source_type=security-state
The errors seem to mostly be parse_error.
:jcj reports that around the same timeframe, his team had converted the security-state/intermediates records from using one kind of base64 encoding to another one. On the hypothesis that this was related somehow, we asked him to roll back the change. He did, and perhaps the errors have slowed, although it's hard to say.
I was able to produce parse_error while syncing security-state/intermediates using Remote Settings Dev Tools on the last Firefox build on my laptop, which is based off of commit 6daf8919d66e75e141ca2bc8ec5defd07cf75bf3 (a week ago). (I'm not 100% sure that it's exactly the same as the errors we are seeing in telemetry.) To reproduce this, I did:

Start local build
Open about:remotesettings. It seemed to open by default pointing at stage.
security-state/intermediates may not be listed; if not, wait a few minutes and refresh the page
""Clear ALL local data""
""Force sync"" security-state/intermediates
""Poll server""
""Force sync"" security-state/intermediates
An error is produced on the left-hand panel and an exception is produced in the browser toolbox.

In other words, the kinto sync is failing because the client thinks it has local changes and is trying to push those changes to the server, which Cloudfront doesn't allow. Indeed, when I look at the security state records using the browser toolbox storage inspector, I see that some are marked ""updated"". I eventually tracked this down to https://github.com/Kinto/kinto.js/issues/989.
If this is the cause of the recent spate of errors, why did it suddenly happen starting the 10th? If not, what is the real cause?

 ",Delay exiting stub installer until after browser has started,"Currently, the installers run the newly installed browser when installation is complete, and then immediately exit. This means there is some delay between the installer window going away and a browser window appearing, so the user has to wait with no indication that anything is happening. We could make browser startup feel faster if we delay exiting the installer until browser startup is substantially complete (which we could most simply define as being when a window has appeared).

We should only do this in the stub installer, because it isn't really conceptually appropriate for the full installer, and because the stub is still running a progress bar when it exits, but the full installer has a finish page."

I am trying to run Firebird 0.6.1 on Windows XP SP1.
The ""plain"" Mozilla 1.5a is running on my XP machine.
At home I can successfully run Firebird on Win 2000 SP4.

After installation on my XP machine, Firebird starts up, little
browser windows comes, pop-up asking for setting it to default
browser, and status bar shows ""Connecting to www.mozilla.org ..."".
Nothing else happens ...

The computer runs for about 20 seconds, CPU is at 80-98%
capacity, and then Firebird crashes with a log file 
""appcompat.txt"" (I copied the content). The error signature
says:

AppName: mozillafirebird.exe
AppVer: 1.5.20030.7265
ModName: unknown
ModVer: 0.0.0.0
Offset: 03db085e

I tried to restart the computer, disabled anti-virus software, etc.etc. but it
simply doesn't want to run ...   =:-(

Reproducible: Always

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

Today (14 Mar 2005) used the link on Firefox homepage to install the setup
1.0.1.exe ver (4.59MB download, file version 3,12,0,0.) After the install
symantic detected pwsteal trojan. I do not have AOL installed. I use earthlink

in the quarantine file within the symantic systemworks 2001 Norton antivirus
section (looked there to cite where exactly the trojan was detected in Windows
folder after the Firefox install.)

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
Updated to ver 1.0.1 Firefox browser, and not installed viruses nor trojans in
the process.

In the reboot after the Firefox Setup 1.0.1.exe Symantic detected the PWsteal
trojan. I selected ""Q"" for quarantine and continued with the reboot process.
Using the Firefox homepage

Steps to reproduce:

Go to anz.com.au and open internet banking
Go to 'accounts', 'view online statements'
Open a pdf account statement.

(This is consistently reproducible on my machine, but may be difficult without access to an ANZ account. Perhaps reproducible in different online banking systems?)


Actual results:

The pdf fails to render properly, showing a black screen with partial rendering of pdf. After closing this window, all text in firefox menus/tabs/address bar/etc. disappears.
This is fixed by closing and re-opening Firefox.


Expected results:

Proper rendering of pdf, and proper rendering of text after closing pdf.

"Session Restore
 ","When restoring a session, ""about:home"" is displayed in the selected tab before the tab is restored","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140716183446

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set Firefox to ""Restore windows and tabs from last time""
2. Set ""Don't restore tabs until I click on them""
3. Restore a session, and click an inactive tab to restore it.


Actual results:

Firefox briefly displays a different page (usually about:home, sometimes the session restore screen or something else), then briefly displays a blank tab with the title ""new tab"", then restores the page from the session.


Expected results:

Restore the page immediately to the tab, do not call up a different page first, and do not call up a ""new tab"" page before displaying the page."

"Tabbed Browser
 ","browser.xml's destructor can over-remove observer, causing exceptions","I've seen exceptions (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) occur in two places when calling
nsIObserverService::removeObserver .  These are:

[Exception... ""Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)
[nsIObserverService.removeObserver]""  nsresult: ""0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)""
 location: ""JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: destroy
:: line 578""  data: no]

[Exception... ""Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)
[nsIObserverService.removeObserver]""  nsresult: ""0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)""
 location: ""JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: Shutdown :: line
837""  data: no]

The latter of these exceptions is pretty much guaranteed to cause memory leaks
because the code following fails to be executed.

I think what's happening is this:
 * browser.js and browser.xml both register and unregister the *same* observer
for the same thing (""browser:purge-session-history"")
 * browser.xml has a destroy method that's called by tabbrowser, and it also
calls that destroy method again itself (in its <destructor>).  This means that
the browser.xml code registers the observer once and unregisters it twice.

The observer service tolerates having the same observer registered multiple
times -- it just needs to be removed the same number of times that it's added. 
I think the reason that the location of the exception varies is that (since we
have two adds and three removes) the order of the removes varies, and it's
always the third one that throws.

The easy (and safe, I think) fix is to make browser.xml not unregister things
twice.  I'll attach a patch to do that.  I haven't seen the exceptions happen
since I started running with that patch.  (That said, I never figured out the
exact conditions under which they occur.)

However, I'm not really sure if this code is still needed:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.js&rev=1.382&mark=691-692,905#686
However, I've done enough poking at this code already, so I'll leave that to
somebody else to figure out, if they want to."

 ","Ensure we can distinguish auto-imported bookmarks / bookmark folders from others, and remove only the auto-imported ones when the user chooses 'undo' for the automatic migration","Right now we will just remove everything, which also removes the default bookmarks and means we're not comfortable with allowing the user the 'undo' option for any length of time, because we'll also delete bookmarks they've created since the import.

When I talked about this with Marco, it seemed our best bet was going to be using the annotations API.

There are two issues with this:
1) the annotations API is sync, which is potentially problematic for perf, and IIRC requires bookmark ids which we might not always keep/have from the insertion, requiring a separate lookup. So it's slightly painful to integrate at the moment.
2) similar to bug 1285575, we'd need to teach all the migrators to annotate their bookmarks. However, unlike bug 1285575, almost all the migrators support bookmarks (only a few know about passwords). So this is time-consuming to write, and error-prone (what if we get a new browser migrator and we forget to do it there, etc.). It's likely a good idea to unify the ""turn this JS-based data into actual bookmarks"" part of the migrators in some way, which will avoid having to write (and/or potentially update/rewrite) this code N times for N migrators."

 ",Generate shorter GUIDs than nsIUUIDGenerator,"uuidgen.generateUUID returns a 38 character GUID like
{494c6659-5c94-7746-be55-6461e7dae103}

We already strip off the {}s and end up with 36 characters and could get down to 32 hex digits.

If we use something base64-like, we could encode 128bits of information in ~22 characters. Base64 actually pads data out to multiples of 4 characters, so 128 bits would show up as 24 characters.

If we don't care about the full 128-bit range, we can shortcut with 126 bits which would result in 4x fewer possibilities.

126 comes from 21 6-bit values. If we drop that to 20 characters, it would be a 120-bit GUID that provides 1.329227995784917e+36 possible values.

Part of the reason for shorter guids is to save on some overhead from returning/requesting a list of GUIDs and some minor savings per record."

 ",New link detection may not be reliable causing us to not Sync when we should,"On a local VM that's slow to come out of sleep, I saw sync failing to work due to it believing the network is down when it wasn't. I could see this ~50% of the time when the VM was on a spinning disk, but haven't yet seen it since I moved the VM to a SDD.

NetworkLinkService.linkStatusKnown was true (although we don't check that - we should)

NetworkLinkService.isLinkUp was false, even though I could use the browser just fine.

Ed notes this probably means something is wrong in https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/system/win32/nsNotifyAddrListener.cpp#613, but that's going to be a bit tricky in my VM and may turn out to be something out of our control (eg, Windows may not be notifying us).

This may be vmware specific, but it worries me - and the impact is very bad - not syncing.

Off the top of my head, I wonder if we could do something like:

* Put the check for this behind a pref, defaulting it to disabled.
* At some point when we know the network must be up, check the NetworkLinkService's status, and if it reports the network is *not* up, emit a telemetry event.
* When we get confidence that it is doing no harm, flip the pref to true.

"Sync
 ",Bookmarks de-duping changes item GUID without changing reference in parent record,"On a test profile, the validator tells me:

> Server record references child DbFRuGKzK7e2 that doesn't exist on the server.

and the record with the reference is ""menu"" with childGUIDs [""1upn0DjHWM0h"", ""q1otz3OaoK-6"", ""DbFRuGKzK7e2"", ""SpnHPUdolgVw"", ""ZsXNl9WUqjIe"", ""MCk-v4SG0eyk"", ""buaNIJIeTStt"", ""I6s-dTVEHJxm""]

Grepping through the logs:

So an incoming ""menu"" record, with 2 children of interest: DbFRuGKzK7e2 and MCk-v4SG0eyk - both are separators

> 1464576351626	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	Number of rows matching GUID MCk-v4SG0eyk: 0

So MCk-v4SG0eyk is a new record we haven't seen before.

> 1464576351627	Sync.Engine.Bookmarks	TRACE	Local item DbFRuGKzK7e2 is a duplicate for incoming item MCk-v4SG0eyk

We've decided the incoming item MCk-v4SG0eyk is a dupe of DbFRuGKzK7e2 - probably because of ""pos"" being wrong (bug 1228827 comment 4)

> 1464576351628	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	Number of rows matching GUID DbFRuGKzK7e2: 1

> 1464576351628	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	Number of rows matching GUID MCk-v4SG0eyk: 1

So now there's no local record with DbFRuGKzK7e2 - the existing one had its GUID changed to MCk-v4SG0eyk.

> 1464576351629	Sync.Engine.Bookmarks	TRACE	Finding mapping: Bookmarks Menu, s2

> 1464576351630	Sync.Engine.Bookmarks	TRACE	Skipping reconciled incoming item MCk-v4SG0eyk

Then later we reorder the children of menu:
> 1464576351894	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	reordering children of: menu
...
> 1464576351895	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	Number of rows matching GUID DbFRuGKzK7e2: 0
> 1464576351895	Sync.Store.Bookmarks	TRACE	Could not locate record DbFRuGKzK7e2

At which point we've removed the child from the local version of ""menu"", and finally:

> 1464576352161	Sync.Collection	DEBUG	mesg: DELETE success 200 https://sync-345-us-west-2.sync.services.mozilla.com/1.5/46723051/storage/bookmarks?ids=DbFRuGKzK7e2

We deleted the record from the server - but the parent record ""menu"" has not been updated on the server - the server record now references *both* GUIDs as being children.

While this is a separator, I see no reason to believe the same thing isn't going to happen if a real bookmark is de-duped. There also don't seem to be any existing tests for bookmark duplicates :(

Naively, it looks like _orderChildren should record a boolean to indicate if it actually changed the ordering, and if so, that item should be marked again for upload. The obvious risk here is a ""sync loop"" though - another client does its own faulty de-duplication and re-uploads the parent, then we do the same, repeat ad-nauseum.

Richard, any insights here?"
"Toolbars and Customization
 ",Need to sync toolbar with icons/text preferences and icon size when new localstore.rdf created,"In cases when the contents of an existing localstore.rdf file is not being used  (with the exception of safe-mode) the toolbar icons/text preferences and icon size preferences need to be applied.

These cases include:

1.  localstore.rdf is absent.
2.  localstore.rdf is being ignored because it has been determined to be corrupt.
3.  The code in bug 404109 is ignoring the localstore.rdf to reset the toolbars to default so that the home button displays on the bookmarks toolbar.

Not doing so results in an inconsistency between the displayed UI and what is selected in the preferences panel.

This problem is exacerbated by the code for bug 404109 which is slated for inclusion in Firefox beta3.

That is why i requested blocker and set target-milestone to beta3.  Fell free to re-target as appropriate, I just wanted to make sure the appropriate people would be made aware of the issue before the beta3 release."

 ",Make certificate exceptions on the new cert error pages permanent by default,"(Filing this bug as a follow-up to a Slack discussion.)


Previously, when we hit a self-signed certificate, we allowed the user to add a permanent exception by clicking through several dialogs. We recently changed that to be a temporary two-click exception which cannot be easily made permanent (other than by adding it manually in preferences.

Getting the behavior right here is hard because there are many different scenarios in which we could encounter this, some being bad/discouraged (e.g. internet hosts, MitM attacker on public wireless) and others being ok (e.g. embedded hosts on the local home network).

We cannot easily distinguish between these cases (not on a network level, and even if we could on a network level, it might still be a public LAN with an attacker). 

What we could do however is to check, if we visited this site/host before. If this our ""first contact"" with the host, it might be worth presenting the user with an easy way to add a permanent exception (and a permanent exception here would be more secure than a temporary exception). If however we have visited this host before and we successfully connected without an exception (regular cert) and we now see a self-signed certificate, that seems like an entirely different situation that makes a MitM very likely and we could make the override harder.

We would still have to figure out technical details on how to confirm that we successfully visited the site before and that it didn't come with a self-signed cert previously."

- Ctrl-V (paste)

I estimate that this fails about 5% of the time. What happens is that the previous contents of the clipboard are pasted instead, so I assume that the copy-to-clipboard isn't actually working.

 ",places organizer should allow browsing and searching of downloads,"Copied over the relevant requirement bits from email:

The goal would be to be able to, from the Places organizer in a ""Downloads"" view:

 - search and list by name of downloaded file
 - try to launch the downloaded file based on the location to which
it was saved on disk
 - re-start the download if the file can't be found

> What would the default visible columns be? Shortname and local path?

Also probably ""downloaded from"" and show the referrer, which IIRC we
now already store.

Also:

1. The (i) info button now opens the Places Manager with focus on the
selected download
2. The Search button, as always, goes off to search the Places Manager

The design expects that the Places Manager knows:

 - name of the file
 - source URL for download
 - target location for download
 - date/time of the download
 - size of the download"

"Theme
 ",Make the legend tabs focusable,"Quoting :fvsch from bug 1561334 comment #1:

Tabs are implemented as labels with hidden radio inputs. Not sure that's the best implementation of a tab pattern. Maybe we should go with a JS implementation of an ARIA tab pattern, where you focus the whole tab group and use the arrow keys to select tabs?
If we keep the radio input implementation, instead of using display:none this could work:

#legend {
  overflow: hidden;
}
#legend input {
  position: absolute;
  left: -100px;
}
#legend label:hover,
#legend input:focus + label {
  background-color: ...;
}
#legend input:focus + label {
  outline: solid 2px;
  outline-offset: -2px;
}

To mek, for both a screen reader and keyboard user point of view, this should probably become an ARIA tab group as Florence suggests above.

I got this link from a post in some Israeli forum. The sample spoofing page was
provided by the person who wrote that post (aparently not somebody who likes
Mozilla).

The link for the full-disclosure message is:

http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2004-July/024372.html

It also contains information on how to reproduce the problem.

This is taken from full-disclosure:

--------------------------------

Firefox has caching problem, as a result of that someone can 
spoof a certificate of any website and use it as his/her own.
The problem is exploited using onunload inside  < body> and 
redirection using Http-equiv Refresh metatag,document.write()
and document.close()

First you direct the redirection metatag to the website 
of which you want to spoof the certificate, then inside 
the < body> tag you add onulnoad script so you can control
the output inside the webpage with the spoofed certificate.

After that you say to firefox, as soon as you unload this page 
close the stream, aparently the stream you close is 
the redirection website, you do that with 
document.close().

Now you can write anything you want , you do that 
using document.write(). After writing the content of you choice
you close the stream again , usually firefox wont display your content,
although if you check the source code you see it , so the last thing 
is to refresh the new page (do that using window.location.reload()), 
after that you have your domain name in the url field , your content 
in the browser and the magic yellow Lock on the bottom left corner, 
if you pass your mouse over it you will see displayed the name of 
the website you spoofed the certificate, if you double click on it you 
will check full information of the certificate without any warning !

You dont need to have SSL in your website ! it will work with 
http.

Additional using this bug malicious websites can bypass content 
filtering using SSL properties.

"PDF Viewer
 ",PDF Print Scaling on PC,"Printing PDF documents from PC (tested on Windows 10, Firefox version 59.0.1) results unavoidably in scaled or misaligned content.  This is a critical issue for all applications where accurate print registration is needed (printing labels, checks, etc.).

Steps to Reproduce
1. Open attached document in Firefox on PC
2. Print document using integrated PDF viewer (pdf.js)
3. Resulting print is scaled to less than 100% size (an easy way to check this is to measure the shaded area, top to bottom; it should be exactly 10"")

NOTE: Using File > Page Setup to uncheck ""Shrink to fit Page Width"" will results in print at 100% scale, but the page contents are nevertheless misaligned (shifted down and to the right).  Adjusting page margins from 0.5"" to 0.0"" has no effect.

Expected Results
Any PDF document with viewer preference PrintScaling = ""None"" should, by default, print at 100% scale and should align appropriately on the printed page.  In our example, the printed result should have a shaded area exactly 10"" tall with a 0.5"" white space on top and bottom.  Interestingly, printing from Firefox for Mac produces the expected results while PC does not.

The PrintScaling preference is part of the ISO PDF specification and is honored by other applications (e.g. Adobe Acrobat, Reader, etc.)."

 ",Store the sync ID and last sync time for bookmarks and history in Places,"Firefox has code to recover from a missing or corrupt places.sqlite - it recreates it (also recreating all default bookmarks etc). But Sync doesn't re-populate the bookmarks etc - they remain missing from that profile.

To reproduce:
* Make a profile, make some bookmarks, sync.
* Make a second profile, sync, observer all bookmarks from first profile exist.
* Exit, then delete places.sqlite from second profile.
* Restart second profile - observe default bookmarks exist but none of those new bookmarks from the first profile exist, even after syncing.

This is Sync optimizing for the ""correct"" case but it should have some way of detecting and handling this (ie, doing a reset automatically).

Things tend to get back to normal after signing out of Sync on that second profile then signing back in.

The simplest fix might be for the code that handles the creation of places to write a pref or similar with the time that happened, and sync could compare that with the timestamps it already uses."

 ",e10s EventTarget shim is broken,"I found a major bug in the shim code while working on bug 1059007. When you create a new Interposition, you're allowed to pass in an existing one that it inherits from. We use the proto chain to link them together. However, when looking for shims for a particular property, we use interp.hasOwnProperty, which doesn't actually look at the prototype.

The reason I switched to hasOwnPrototype is because I didn't want stuff from Object.prototype showing up as a shim. However, we can just set the prototype of the base shims to null to avoid that.

I also added a name property to every shim, which helps debugging. And I fixed a variable that needed |let| in front of it.

It's pretty clear that we need tests for this code though. I'll get working on that and post in this bug when I'm done."

 ",Allow users to choose whether search suggestions or history suggestions come first in the address bar.,"In 57 we unified the address and search bars for new users. Some users may have a search-first workflow (we believe many Chrome users fall into this workflow) and some users have a history-first workflow (we believe most long-time Fx users fall into this workflow).

This work creates a UI setting under ""Preferences > Search"" to allow users to switch between search-first or history-first, just as we allow them to choose between unified vs. 2 bars. The target is Fx 59, and this has a new string dependency. 

Requirements:

1. Offer a new setting (see screencap) beneath the choice of unified vs. 2 bars. In a conversation with Past and Shorlander, we determined that the fastest/easiest implementation is a single checkbox so that we have a binary choice. 

* NOTE: while we will offer a binary choice to users (search-first or history-first), the underlying pref to change address bar composition (browser.urlbar.matchBuckets) is a string at could have many other values than the two we'll offer users via a UI pref. It's possible a power user changed this themselves, or it's possible that the user is part of a shield study where we're testing new combinations. 


2. The copy string is TBD and will say something like:

""[x] Prioritize search suggestions over history results in the address bar""

 MHeubusch will confirm the final string so that we can land in 59 ASAP.


In addition to this new user UI setting, there is some work to migrate/set this setting for new installs while keeping existing users exactly as they are:

3. Since 57, all new profile installs are given unification by default. These users should also get search-first results in the address bar. Currently we're giving these users search-first via Shield. This work should also properly set these new/unified users to the search-first underly pref which they can then change on their own via this new Preferences > Search setting.

4. All existing profiles were unchanged in 57, we did not unify their bar and they should also *keep* history results first. If those users want search-results first in the address bar, they can go into Preferences > Search and set that themselves."

The fix to bug 254225 hastily eliminated the Command-LeftArrow and
Command-RightArrow keyboard shortcuts from Mac builds.  This was seemingly done
without any discussion.

These keyboard shortcuts have been in every Mac browser since the beginning of
time.  It's one thing if Firefox does not wish to use these keystrokes as its
primary shortcuts or expose them in the Go menu, but it's another thing entirely
to remove them altogether.

All other Mac browsers, including Safari, Camino, and Seamonkey, support the
Command-Arrow shortcuts IN ADDITION  to Command-[ and Command-].  In each case,
the [ and ] shortcuts are the ones visible in the menus, but the arrows still
work.  When bug 117186 was fixed (the Seamonkey companion to bug 254225), the
Command-Arrow shortcuts were allowed to remain.

The Command-Arrow shortcuts are what many users expect, and they should not be
removed.

Steps to reproduce:

To reproduce this issue let's say I am typing ""test"" in the address bar or any word such as ""Firefox""
-Using the arrow keys in the keyboard, find the exact search term that will lead into the search engine. (The term with Magnifying glass)
-Without adding anything else select all the term and copy it 
- paste it back to any notepad or to the address bar directly, the term becomes http://test/ or http://firefox/



Actual results:

The given copy and paste result is http://test/ or http://""search term/


Expected results:

Copying should always give the term written itself without the http:// part. 
Some users, like me, uses the address bar to get a neutral results from a text, and this makes it a bit harder."

I think there are two issues here.

1. This line here is async https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/lib/SectionsManager.jsm#L438 which means that event on the next line may fire before the spocs are fetched, and it'll stay this way until the pref is changed again, making it always out of sync by 1 update.

2. If the above is fixed, I'm noticing opening a new tab isn't enough, but you have to refresh it too.

This is mostly because of how shield updates prefs ""at some point"" it's fast, but happens after the browser runs, and how activity stream reads that pref.

Basically an extension should be able to implement a component that implements at the very least:

nsINavHistoryContainerResultNode (the container itself, which tells the fe about the children it has)

nsINavHistory*ResultNode (for the individual child results, returned by the above's |getChild| method).

There should be a GUI method implemented for the management of search engine
extensions in the toolbar. It is a straightforward process to add new ones using
the ""Add New Engines"" option in the drop-down menu, but there is presently no
way to use the GUI to manage installed plugins. Currently, the files have to be
removed manually from the searchplugins folder through the filesystem, which
works fine but is a hassle. Instead of an ""add engines"" menuitem which goes
directly to Mycroft, a GUI interface should be implemented, perhaps under ""Web
Features"" which could have controls for adding (which would go to Mycroft),
removing (would work like the extensions list - click on one and click remove to
get rid of it). Finally, search engines should be stored in user profile, not in
the browser root, so they persist if the browser is upgraded.

The position of the underline was approved in the previous bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1387117

I think it is wrong by one pixel but perhaps we should look at if there is anything else we can do.

The current selected tab shows 1px under and 1px over the line. Other tabs just show the one above.

A vast improvement is had just by adding:

"Firefox Accounts
 ",Fix FxA storage to not require re-reading disk on every request.,"Via bug 1139743. getSignedInUserData never caches the user data in memory due to some of the data being locked behind the master-password - we re-read on each request just in-case the MP is now unlocked.

The main issue is really that the AccountState object doesn't know what data is stored where.  Off the top of my head, a solution might be:

* The Storage class grows new methods to separate the reading of ""always available"" data from the ""possibly locked"" data.

* The AccountState object then is responsible for calling both of these, and thus can become aware of what bits came from where, and cache them appropriate (eg, it should be able to immediately cache the ""always available"" data, and then cache the ""possibly locked"" data once we are able to get it.

* AccountState then returns the merged data with the callers being unaware of the change.

That bug also has many comments for how we can better structure the tests (eg, around bug 1139743 comment 48)"

Firefox consistently crashes when viewing the following webpage:
http://www.ittime.com.cn/content.asp?id=4721

it is one of the IT weekly magzine site in China. I visisted from time to time.
A weeks ago, I started to realize that Firefox consistently crashes when loading this site (not just this page, but other pages on this site).
I was using Firefox 1.5 or 1.6. After the initial crash, I switched to 2.0.
but the crash persist.

The problem is with Firefox, you do not give out any indication of what went wrong, so I can not report back to the website owner, specific details of the problem.

Can someone look into it?

Regards,

Ming

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the url I posted.
2. wait for the web page to be loaded
3. in the middle of loading the page, you will see a crash of the browser.
Actual Results:  
the browse would crash, saying sorry for inconvenience, etc.

Expected Results:  
the webpage being displayed properly.

in general, this site http://www.ittime.com.cn/ would cause Firefox to crash.
you can visit different pages and wait a few second for the crash to occur.

BTW, after the crash, when I restart firefox, if I goes into a different tab, you may avoid the crash. but as soon as you visit the tab with the trouble-some url, the crash will consistently occur."

HCM Theme Telemetry Extension Request

Unfortunately you cannot use the short form to extend an expiry to ""never"" as it has no place on which to ensure that an individual is going to be responsible for the metric over its permanent lifespan. You will need to resubmit this review request using the full form.

Also, it is considered best practice to include a regression test for permanent collections to ensure they don't break in their extended lifespan. [TelemetryTestUtils.jsm](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/telemetry/tests/utils/TelemetryTestUtils.jsm) is a helpful module for writing such tests."

 ",Store recency of browser data in telemetry when importing to see how good a predictor default browser is,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1275114 +++

Bug 1248077 seeks to improve the experience of the first-run ""import data from another browser"" process by doing it automatically. We'd like to gather some additional data to help understand if our selection of what browser to import from is doing a good job, by looking more closely at the choices users are currently making. As with the original probes added in bug 731025, these will need to be opt-out because they need to record things before the browser has fully started for the first time.

<snip #1 and #2 which are in bug 1275114>

3) How fresh/relevant is the data available from other browsers? In some cases, the user's default browser may not be the browser they actually use the most (and thus want to import from). In other cases, the most-recently-used browser may not have been used for anything more than downloading Firefox, so importing that minimal history and default bookmarks is not really useful. Again, with telemetry analysis, we'd like to see how often the browser users actually import from is actually what we think is the freshest.


#3 is a little tricky to define precisely, as difficulty of implementation may guide what we actually do. I'd suggest a erring on the side of simplicity to see what the initial signal looks like. One option would be to pick a particular data source (bookmarks? history? passwords? all?), and see how old the most recent entry is. A file timestamp might be enough. Another option would be to see how many entries there are for a type -- is the user importing from the browser with lots of bookmarks/history/passwords? Are browsers with < X bookmarks/history/passwords generally ignored?"

 ",FF91 and newer produce *huge* CPU-Load in certain situations,"Steps to reproduce:
Systems: Debian 11, Mint 19.3, Windows7/Server2k8R2
FF-Versions: FF91 and newer
After updating from FF78LTS (where the bug did not appear that noticable) to FF91LTS unknown circumstances frequently appear leading to FF producing huge CPU load, although the websites have no visible animation or any other tasks to do. Reloading the website temporary fixes the bug - but only until the unknown circumstances reappear some minutes later.
This happens with different websites - all being long-time-interacted rich internet applications. So a bug in a website itself can be ruled out.
Steps to reproduce:

login to https://demo.sogo.nu/SOGo/ using username ""sogo1"" and pw ""sogo1""
make sure, the list of emails displayed in ""inbox"" is longer than the box is  - so a scrollbar is displayed (if not, create some emails by copying them to/from ""drafts"" and back to ""inbox"")
select first mail in inbox
press the down key
see the cpu going crazy

On computers with weak/old CPUs the impact was more noticable than on such with modern CPUs.
Accessing the erroneous firefox instance by a RDP connection also shows a huge traffic being transferred although there is no motion/animation. So unnecessary redraws of the whole FF window must be the case.
As far as I can tell from the debug console the problem seems to be related to high frequently calls of ""requestAnimationFrame"". Setting ""gfx.webrender.force-disabled"" to ""true"" seems to lower the CPU consumption.
I was able to reproduce the problem on different machines, settings and also with newer Versions of FF (tested up to FF95.0.1):

"Theme
 ",Third-party themes broken on Vista due to chrome override additions from bug 416531,"[Spin-off from bug 416531, comment #27]

Ed Hume <ehume@pshrink.com> says:

""I believe you have chosen an unwise way to proceed with this.

Please look at this thread:

http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=630829

Basically, you have broken every third party theme for the Vista environment.

I proposed an addition to chrome.manifest that would reverse the
classic.manifest overrides and restore our themes to working condition. It did
not work.

What this means is that all themers will have to:

1. Discover from unhappy Vista users that certain buttons - some obvious, some
obscure - do not work.

2. Figure out what is wrong.

3. Figure out how to fix it.

In the short term, we themers will have to duplicate, for each of our themes,
each of the files you have reassigned. Each developer, each theme. That's a lot
of extra MB running through Moz Update, and a lot of man-hours spent finding,
figuring and fixing by all the many theme developers.

So I ask: why break everybody else's themes? 

Is there another method?

One thing that occurs to me is that you could split the Firefox builds. You
have three now - Linux, OSX and Windows. You could have four: Linux, OSX,
Windows and  Vista. OK, I know that's a bit harsh, but what you are doing to
third party developers is also harsh; don't forget, we haven't heard from
extension developers yet.

Or you could do something else. Like fixing the chrome overrides bug. Or -
heaven forfend - leave the current default as the default, and supply the Aero
theme as an Add-on at AMO.

Or even package the Aero theme as an add-on that ships with each windows build.
That way, a user - even a non-Vista user - could choose the Aero theme from the
Add-ons window. Heck, you could even use your classic.manifest file to choose
which theme would be the default, based on OS. This would give the Vista users
the Aero experience ab initio without breaking everybody else's themes.

But please withdraw your current fix."""

This is easy for the developers of the extension to detect if they compile a debug build of Firefox and test the extension in that debug build:  then they will see assertion dialogs whenever they violate the threadsafety invariants (with an option to drop into the debugger).

 ",Inaccurate Telemetry for Session Store time,"I don't think the simpleMeasurements.sessionRestoreInit and simpleMeasurements.sessionRestored timestamps are accurate.

Anecdote:

It takes a long while for session restore to complete in my e10s nightly on Windows. The session consists of about ~5 windows and 10 tabs in e10s. The tab spinners spin for a while and the tab content isn't ready, but I notice in about:telemetry that the sessionRestored timestamp gets set well before the session is truly restored.

We should:

a) Figure out exactly what sessionRestored means
b) Add a new, more meaningful measurement of session restore time

This will also help with e10s perf comparisons."

A number of considerations apply here, and it's explicitly not the goal of this metabug to cover every single one of them, nor is it the intention of this metabug to come up with an exhaustive list of every part of Firefox that we *could* change based on machine performance.

Notable points that we *will* address as part of this project (one way or another):

- do our best (given time and other constraints) to be data-driven when coming up with a way of classifying machine performance
- ensure that determining machine performance ""in the field"" doesn't require a ""live"" performance test run on the machine (a la Windows Experience Index) and that determining the machine performance doesn't otherwise negatively impact performance.
- have a possibility for user override/choice. This also helps with testing / reproducing issues.
- somehow take privacy.resistFingerprinting into account (it's not really clear we should always do this, e.g. for UI animations in browser chrome we probably don't need to, for things like GC behavior that are web-exposed, we do)
- once we have a solid basis for classifying machine performance, consider how/whether this can be applied on mobile"

2) Click-and-drag a bookmark to a location a few entries up or down in the menu
3) Release mouse button

The bookmark that was dragged should end up where you dropped it. I've seen it jump to the end, only move 1 spot, move half-way, or not move at all. I'm not sure what the pattern is, it seems random.

This is especially annoying because sometimes when opening a folder I'll fumble a bit and accidently drag the first bookmark a couple of pixels. If I'm lucky it won't move, if I'm unlucky it jumps to somewhere else in the folder.

Rearranging the bookmarks in the Bookmarks Organizer works fine.

Steps to reproduce:

I started Firefox Nightly with many tabs restored from the previous session, about 880 tabs. Right clicked over the first tab, and clicked ""Bookmark All Tabs""



Actual results:

The dialog appears without the usual ""[Folder Name]"" and Folder (the parent folder) input fields, therefore I cannot type a folder name.
Only the ""Add Bookmarks"" and ""Cancel"" buttons appear.
Since I couldn't type a folder name to use, I clicked the ""Add Bookmarks"" button, without giving a folder name.

In Nightly 2017-07-26, a default bookmarks folder with the name ""[Folder Name]"" was created, but was empty (instead of with about 880 tabs ...)

After updating to the latest Nightly 2017-07-30, a default bookmarks folder with the name ""[Folder Name]"" was created, is not empty like with Nightly 2017-07-26, but has only 76 tabs, most of the tabs are missing  (instead of about 880 tabs ...)

After some tries, I found out later that if you wait long enough (about 30 seconds) after clicking ""Bookmark all tabs"", the missing 2 input fields folder name and Folder (parent folder), suddenly appear (!) in the dialog box, enlarging it, and giving me the option to type the folder name. When this happens, all tabs seem to be bookmarked correctly, without missing tabs. 

The time it takes for the missing input fields to appear, sometimes depend on the number of tabs you have in the window, so if you bookmark all tabs on windows with a small number of tabs, you might not notice this.




Expected results:

The input fields on the ""bookmark all tabs"" dialog box should have appeared immediately. 

When bookmarking all tabs without entering a folder name (with the default folder name) before those input fields suddenly appear, all tabs should be bookmarked and there should not be many missing tabs that are not bookmarked."

User experiencing this crash can be found in that thread linked in the bug URL. 

From that thread:

When you connect to my campus's network a dialogue box pops up explaining that additional login information may be required. Usually I just start firefox and it redirects to 1.1.1.1 and I sign in to the campus network with no problems. This worked perfectly while I was using the Release Candidate. At this point, I should also point out that my college has certificate problems and users have to click through a 'this connection is untrusted' screen before reaching the login. Today I updated to the new release and now the browser crashes as soon as it hits 1.1.1.1; it does not even display the untrusted connection screen. If I use IE9 to sign in to the network and then start firefox, it loads up my homepage no problem.

The About Firefox page says I'm up-to-date although I have tried redownloading the official version and trying out the nightly

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When opening the find dialog (Edit > Find in this page), if the text entered is
not found, the message box / popup appears in the way of the Find dialog. This
is annoying having to press OK every time if you have a large text document that
you want to search for various words / strings.

I think a better solution would be for the 'Find in this Page' dialog to expand
down, with a fieldset called 'messages', which would display 'The text you
entered was not found'. Then you can choose to 'hide' the expanded section, or
you could just type something else in and try again. Once you start to type
again the message would disappear. This is hard to explain, I will try and
create an image of what I mean and attach it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.google.com
2. Go to 'Edit > Find in this Page'
3. In the 'Find What:' textbox enter a string of text that isn't on the google
front-page, such as 'hajhfahdjfajdhf jhjshdjfhue' and hit enter.

Actual Results:  
A message box popped up informing me that 'The Text you entered was not found'

Expected Results:  
The 'Find in this page' dialog should expand downwards showing a 'messages'
fieldset, which can display various messages. The main 'Find in this Page'

 ",Clarify the queryContext.autofill property and add an enableAutofill property,"This patch is based on the patch in bug 1520342.

I made the UnifiedComplete provider manually check `context.enableAutofill` before setting `context.autofill`.  If we end up with other providers setting `autofill`, they'd have to be careful to check `enableAutofill` too.  Maybe it would be better to have a `context.autofill` getter that always returns false when `enableAutofill` is false, or a setter that forces it to be false in that case?  Anyway, I opted for a simple approach in this patch.

The patch also rearranges properties so that they're listed in alphabetical order.  Not really necessary, but I think it's easier to pick out properties that way, and it's a logical order for adding more properties."

This is a change for existing users used to seeing history first. We can offer a UI setting to put history first, then search?

This could be simply implemented as a hardcoded pref change. 

If we want to make it slightly more complicated, we could make this dynamic based on the value of maxRichResults, since we may continue to experiment with different numbers of results in the Awesome Bar. Making it dynamic assumes that we want a consistent balance between the first and second result types, and that this merits the extra cruft.

======
Example: 

browser.urlbar.maxRichResults (default is 10) 

total = maxRichResults - 1  // results remaining after heuristic

topNumber = ~~(total/2) // floor division. topNumber is 4 for maxRichResults=10

Note that when I printed the document in the same format with Adobe Acrobat reader the pages came out as desired.

I also tried printing to the printer from FF using 1-up single-sided printing.  The text was visible in this case.  The quality was poor however (it looked more like a scan), perhaps because it had been shrunk slightly to accommodate the header and footer.

Starting with Firefox 3.1b3, whether or not SessionStore saves the current browser state at shutdown when the user sets Firefox to clear the visited pages at browser shutdown, depends on how shutdown is triggered.  

If shutdown is triggered via the File->Exit menu, than the current browser state will be saved.

If shutdown is triggered by closing the last browser window, than the current browser state will be cleared in the sessionstore.js file.

I'm not sure what the desired action should be if the user sets the browser to clear the visited pages on shutdown, but it should not be dependent on how the browser is shut down.

The problem also occurs on the nightly trunk.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the General tab, set the startup option to ""Show my Windows and Tabs From Last Time"".
2. On the privacy tab, check the ""Always clear my private data when I close ..."" checkbox and make sure the ""Visited Pages"" box is checked in the Clear Private Data settings.
3. Open Firefox and load a page.  Click on File->Exit
4. Open Firefox again and once page loads, close it by clicking the ""X"" in the top right corner (Windows version).

Actual Results:  

When the browser is exited using the File->Exit command, the current browser state is saved in sessionstore.js and then restored the next time the browser is run.  
When the browser is exited by closing the last browser window, the state is set to ({""windows"":[],""selectedWindow"":0,""session"":{""state"":""stopped"",""lastUpdate"":1237180299539}}) in sessionstore.js so it is not restored the next time the browser is run.

Expected Results:  

Either the state should be cleared on all instances of shutdown or it should be saved on all instances of shutdown.


Calling the SessionStore API's getBrowserState() during the quit-application notification state results in cleared out session data when when closing the last browser window.  When using File->Exit, the actual current state is return.

This most likely has to do with the order that the observer notifications are coming in when closing the last window as opposed to when using the File->Exit shutdown method."

Should the front-end clear the error on its own in this case or is the test page just wrong for not using updateWith to clear the error?"

Can confirm that if the Tools -> Options... window is open, the popup blocker
completely fails to function and popup windows can be freely triggered. Also
possible that websites can install software in addition to triggering popup
windows whilst the Options window is open (i.e. that the install softare

1. Visit any website that proliferates popup windows.

confirm the software issue but can confirm the popups)

Actual Results:

Updated FxA toolbar menu data collection review for Skyline

data-review+; thanks!

The request is for permanent collection, but the patch only extends collection to 74; I'll assume from your comment that the patch is right.

--

1) Is there or will there be **documentation** that describes the schema for the ultimate data set in a public, complete, and accurate way?

Yes, in Events.yaml.

2) Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes, the Firefox telemetry opt-out.

3) If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

n/a

4) Using the **[category system of data types](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection)** on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, interaction data.

5) Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default-on.

6) Does the instrumentation include the addition of **any *new* identifiers**?

No.

7) Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

8) Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data? (Yes/No)

Yes, Vijay and Leif are responsible for renewing the collections before they expire in 74.

9) Does the data collection use a third-party collection tool? **If yes, escalate to legal.**

No."

 ",Allow remote custom CSS to adjust section and/or card styles,"The idea is to allow exceptions or last-minute fixes to styling to avoid needing code changes and uplifts. For example:
- tweaking the position of some title text by a few pixels
- adjusting the size or color of the description
- overriding the image positioning
- showing/hiding of various card information (showing requires the content to have been rendered instead of omitted)

Potentially this could be used for one-off campaign styling say.. some christmas theme wanting green and red border around the whole section?? So this would be sent down with the section definition instead of built into Firefox.

My current thinking is that the section definition would have more JSON defining the section styling and card styling that then gets applied as inline css to the react component. This is as opposed to a plain css sheet injection that then would require appropriate selectors. Unclear if we want to filter style objects for accepted whitelisted css properties and/or values."

I'm quite sure there are more of these instances, maybe AppCache or Quota Manager.

The problem with that is of course that developers will not understand the criteria by which we flag an iframe as having cookies and users might perceive a higher ""threat"" from third party cookies than was actually present.

We should try to reduce the number of these false positives as much as possible and document the remaining edge cases."

Typically, this occurs with multiple tabs up [this is my usage pattern].  The crash seems to occur if I scroll during page load.  I am tempted to suggest that it seems to occur near the end of the page load, or just after.  I further sense that it may occur on a page that is fully loaded, while other tabs are loading in background following a middle-click.  It also seems to be more likely [a sense, again] if I am scrolling not-slowly.

I have greasemonkey, adblock and tab mix plus enabled, but variations of disabling don't seem to affect this bug.  I can reproduce the bug, generally, but can not tie it to specific pages.

Restarting Fox, or rebooting the machine does not reduce the severity of the rate of crashes.  This is an annoying problem.  I can not tie it to the most recent updates, nor can I exclude it.  Fox, generally, has periods of instability for me, that come and go.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Scroll mouse while viewing a page
2.Increase liklihood of crash, it seems, with:  faster scroll; loading pages in foreground and scrolling it while loading, or scrolling while loading tabs in background
3.
Actual Results:  
Crash of Fox.

Expected Results:  
Stability and no crash"

[Notes]:

The issue is ONLY reproducible if the 2nd remaining card is Sponsored.

[Prerequisites]:

Have the browser.search.region pref set to US.
Have the browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.discoverystream.config set to {""api_key_pref"":""extensions.pocket.oAuthConsumerKey"",""enabled"":false,""collapsible"":true,""show_spocs"":false,""hardcoded_layout"":true,""personalized"":false,""layout_endpoint"":""https://getpocket.cdn.mozilla.net/v3/newtab/layout?version=1&consumer_key=$apiKey&layout_variant=basic""} - Discovery Stream disabled.

[Steps to reproduce]:

Start the browser with the profile from prerequisites and navigate to about:newtab.
Dismiss the first Recommended by Pocket story.
Dismiss the stories from the 3rd position until there are no more stories left.
Restart the browser.
Collapse the Recommended by Pocket section and observe the behavior.

[Expected results]:

The section is collapsed.

[Actual results]:

Nothing happens.

[Additional Notes]:

If the page is refreshed, the section is collapsed. Once this happens, the issue is also reproducible when you try to expand the section.

To enable this only for Nightly builds, firefox.js should be updated to enable the pref when NIGHTLY_BUILD is defined, otherwise leaving it disabled.

See https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c579ce13ca7864c5df9711eda730ceb00501aed3/browser/app/profile/firefox.js#1313,1315,1317 for an example."

However, they're only really balanced if the last tab closed in a window is the
one that was there when it was opened.

I made the mistake of adding the second of these, which breaks the whole rest of
the Shutdown function.

If the addObserver call cited above is actually still needed, I'm really not
sure what needs to be done.  However, I'm hoping that it's not still needed. 
I'll look into it."

 ",print preview. Cannot switch between portrait and landscape using keyboard only.,"In the Print Preview window, a user cannot switch between Portrait and Landscape
using their keyboard (unless they go into Page Setup and change from there). In
my opinion this is both a) an accessibility issue, and b) an inconvenience.

Reproduce: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. File > Print Preview
2. Tab across to try and change layout from portrait to landscape or vice versa
(using keyboard only).

Actual Results:
User tabs from the scale dropdown to the Close button, completely missing the
print layout toggle buttons/options.

Expected Results:
Landscape and Portrait options are able to be accessed via a keyboard,
potentially using radio buttons? or a single button that changes name??

This is a feature request, first off I love the google search box--I've added
more than a few sites to my searchplugin directory.  Currently, when a user
highlights text, and right clicks it, you can search google for that text.  I
think that you should search using whatever searchplugin you're currently using.
 For instance, I've got a search php.net file written, and I'd love to be able
to highlight a function name from a script I'm perusing on groups.google.com and
search php.net using this functionality.  Right now, I have to copy the text
into the box and search that way--not too inconvenient, but could be better.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with text
2. Highlight some text
3. Right-click and choose ""Web Search for...""

Actual Results:  
Searched google.com for the text

When you bookmark a page with a %2B (the plus sign) in the URL, and then reload it using a tag: instead of loading ""...=blocking-firefox3%2B"", it loads ""...=blocking-firefox3+"", which in turn leads to an error page.

Expected Results:

Note that this only occurs when loading the bookmark using the ""block"" tag. When I try to load the bookmark from the Bookmarks menu, it loads just fine. Also, the bookmark *IS* saved correctly (check the library), its just not loaded correctly.

This leads me to believe that its a bug of the tagging service."

"Session Restore
 ",Investigate emitting events for page-tab selection changes prior to events for newly-active document,"Steps to reproduce:
1. Load multiple pages in a single Firefox window
2. Place caret and/or focus within the documents
3. Using Alt+<page tab index> to switch from page to page

Desired results: An event for the page-tab selection change, followed by caret and/or focus events for the newly-active document.

Actual results: Caret and/or focus events for the newly-active document, followed by events for the page-tab selection change.

Rationale: Ideally, a screen reader would speak the newly-selected page tab and then speak where on that newly-active page the user is. If the event ordering were as described in ""desired"", that would JustWork(tm). Because it's not, accomplishing the ideal behavior requires things like checking if the page associated with the current caret-moved and/or focused event is not the same as the page associated with the previous page location. Given how often the caret moves and/or focus changes, this is a drag.

I was chatting with Trev in IRC about this:

<@tbsaunde> so, I think basically the cause is that the  UI page tab thingy whatever it is doesn't actually get selected until after we've changed documents that are being displayed
<@tbsaunde> so naturally the documents events are fired first
<@tbsaunde> so then the question is what can we do about that
<@tbsaunde> I kind of wonder if we can fix this with aria-selected
<@tbsaunde> that is first set aria-selected=""true"" (is that the actual attribute I forget ;p) then switch tabs, then select the page tab thingus in the ui

So I'm filing this as an ""investigate"" request, in case it is doable, for when Trev has some spare time.

Thanks!"
"Tabbed Browser
 ",Split Forms and History engine prefs so each are able to be enabled independently,"The ""form autofill"" work planned for 56 is going to add 2 new sync engines - one for ""payments/credit cards"" and one for ""address/profile"" information (user-facing names for these TBD).

UX has decided that ""History"" and ""Form History"" will be split in all parts of the UI (eg, in about:preferences#privacy, instead of ""Firefox will remember your browsing, download, form and search history, and keep cookie ..."", there will be ""Firefox will remember your browsing, download, and keep cookie ..."" and new options for the existing ""form and search history"" and the new ""profile/address"" features.

They would also like a corresponding change for Sync prefs - ""history"" will be only browsing history (possibly with a user-facing string change), and there will be a new checkbox called ""Forms"" (exact string TBD) which will control the existing form history and the new ""profile/address autofill history"". (There will also be a new checkbox specifically for payments/credit-cards, but that will be a different bug.)

So tl;dr - we'll need a new preference specifically for forms (it is currently piggy-backed on the preference for history), which we can implement now. As the new sync engines are developed, they in-turn will be piggy-backed on the new ""forms"" preference. We'll obviously need to ""migrate"" the default value for this new forms preference based on the current value of the history pref. I believe no change will be needed to the ""declined"" logic, as the engines are already separate there.

Is there anything else I've forgotten?

 ",pdf.js: be smarter about passing image data from the worker,"Currently, we decode all images in a PDF into a 32-bit RGBA buffer in the worker, and then pass that to the main thread, which puts the data to a canvas (in slices, so the main thread doesn't need to use much memory).

There are some cases where this is outrageously inefficient. For example, scanned black and white documents are common. They have one bit per pixel, and so expanding to a 32-bit RGBA buffer is a 32x increase.

Therefore, for certain common, easy cases, we should allow image data to be passed in a form other than 32-bit RGBA. 1-bit black and white is the obvious first alternative.

This complicates things for the main thread display code, but it's worth it. I have a draft patch implementing this. For http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0909/ML090920467.pdf, if you scroll all the way to the bottom and wait for the last page to display...

 ",Bookmarks buffer should force `hasDupe: true`,"The buffer doesn't use `hasDupe`, so it ignores the property on incoming records, and sets it to `false` for outgoing. However, we'll still want to set it correctly for records that we upload, so that older Desktops don't make a mess with their dodgy bookmark deduping.

There are two ways we can do this. One is to store `hasDupe` as a column in the buffer, and simply round-trip it as iOS does. The other is to actually query Places, and set `hasDupe` for bookmarks with similar contents and the same parent title...roughly replicating what the GUID map did before. I would strongly prefer the former.

On the other hand, I think Android does some content-based deduping using a ""recordString"", but *doesn't* check `hasDupe`, so maybe it's OK that we don't set it. Once the buffer is enabled for everyone, we could also set `hasDupe = true` for all records, so that the old duping logic never runs. (However, it might still be set back to `false` if one of those older Desktops changes the bookmark in some way)."
"Bookmarks & History
 ",Avoid GetPageTitle in bookmarkPage,"So here's the first sync-getPageTile->async-getPlaceInfo change we're going to do (See bug 834539 for the new API).

bookmarkPage uses getPageTitle as a fallback for error pages (that is, it tries to find a title from a past successful cases). So we need to use the new getPlaceInfo API, meaning we've to async-ify bookmarkPage as well. Even though it may seem an overkill for a fall-back case, I think it's a step in the right direction considering that all things done by this method should be async at some point (for example, the call to getMostRecentBookmarkForURI). Even more so, bookmarkPage already calls setCharsetForURI, which is async.

While reviewing the code I found some other issues, so I refactored the function a bit.

1. The comment about ""full plugin pages"" isn't true anymore (for a very long time, I think). You can try it on http://www.adobe.com/jp/events/cs3_web_edition_tour/swfs/perform.swf
1.1. Even if it was, the code would fail to handle it because the code attempts to use the content document anyway.
1.2. We got the ""entered"" URL from twice... once from the and once from browser.webNav.currentURI, and once from browser.currentURI, which is just a shortcut for browser.webNav.currentURI. Along with the browser.contentDocument.documentURL case for error pages, this rendered the code somewhat unreadable.

2. Error pages case:
2.1. The error-page charset was saved as the bookmarked page's charset
2.2. Same goes for description.

3. Removed some function names (I'm told they aren't necessary anymore).

4. It was possible for bookmarkPage to start a TM batch but never end it.

5. The description anno was saved even if there was no description available. This is bad given that it's going to be removed at some point.

6. NOT FIXED IN THIS PATCH: some things done by bookmarkPage don't seem right for the sidebar case. I think it's better to fix it by not using the panel in that case.

I'm pretty sure some browser tests needs to be updated to support the new async-nature of this method, so for now I'm only asking for feedback."

 ",Tweak engine registration process to better facilitate external engines,"Engine registration has magic that's not leveraged and makes it tricky to add ""external"" engines that live outside the sync tree. This bug is to address that, in preparation for 2 new formautofill engines.

In particular, the patch:

* Removes the pref ""services.sync.registerEngines"" as I believe things are likely to break if someone adjusts this pref - the correct way to ""remove"" and engine is to simply disable it. Note however the pref is still consulted for tests - there's just no default value, and all engines are registered by default.

* Change the simple map of engine names to modules into a map that is more flexible - so the new autofill engines would just require, say:

+  Addresses: {module: ""resource://formautofill/FormAutofillSync.jsm"",

Build ID: 20170921100141

Steps to reproduce:

A recent change in the bookmark toolbar design has rendered the bookmarks and folders on the toolbar much more difficult to use.

Sizes measured from screenshots.

FF 57:

At NORMAL density:

Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar: 19px vertical
Top clearance: 4px
Bottom clearance: 2px

At COMPACT density:

Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar: 19px vertical
Top clearance: 3px
Bottom clearance: 2px

At TOUCH density:

Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar: 25px vertical
Top clearance: 4px
Bottom clearance: 2px


FF 56:

At NORMAL density:

Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar: 24px vertical
Top clearance: 7px
Bottom clearance: 0px

At COMPACT density:

Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar: 24px vertical
Top clearance: 2px
Bottom clearance: 0px


Active target area of bookmark/folder on bookmark toolbar with bookmark menu in toolbar: 26px vertical


In all cases, normal bookmark target heights are 22px.


A recently fixed bug made it so that buttons on the toolbar do not cause the toolbar size to change.  With that, I would then expect the target area height to be 24px with or without the bookmark menu.

Instead, the target area has been reduced to 19 px, a 20%-25% reduction in target area vertical size, and equal to the compact density level.

Meanwhile, normal bookmarks within the menus have a vertical target size of 22px, so the toolbar bookmarks are shorter even than normal bookmarks.

Touch density makes the bookmark toolbar item heights usable, but also modifies the rest of the theme in undesired ways.





Actual results:

Bookmark toolbar items have had their height reduced to compact levels.


Expected results:

Bookmark toolbar item target heights at normal density should be sized to a usable level, such as that matching normal bookmarks (22px) or the old default (24px)."

Steps to reproduce:

Since November 15th we see thousands of additional http requests coming to our SAP webshop server.

The requests are calling our shop front page via our company webpage (www.hbm.com) which contains a link to the shop.

This happens also with internal users opening only the internal webpage which also contains a link to the webshop. We have a colleague who opened the internal page for an hour this morning and had over 400 requests to the webshop in our log file. But she did not click on the webshop link at all. She is currently using Firefox 58.0b11 (64bit).

So it seems that the new Firefox 57/58 is somehow scanning links in the background on our internal and external webpage and connecting the webshop behind hundreds of times. The Firefox user does not see these background connections.

We have a serious issue with our webshop server as every request causes various connections to our SAP backend systems and slow them down.

Please send emails answers to owp-support@hbm.com 

Thank you.

When I type in the Google search field, nothing shows up.

I tried some other websites, and still nothing.  The only one that works has no text, www.purple.com.

Another weird thing is that when you open a tab, like troubleshooting info, then switch back to the Google tab, the Google tab now shows the troubleshooting page.

Something is really wrong.  I hate having to try a reset because it screws everything up, if it even will fix this, and I don't think users should have to reset because of a new version.

#ifdef XP_MACOSX
#elif defined(ANDROID)
#else
# if defined(XP_UNIX)

So the # if defined(XP_UNIX) was effectively disabled and became a dead code.
Is this change intentional? (If so, feel free to close this bug.) After browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel is turned on, this bug would no longer matter because we no longer use /tmp on Unix.

"Migration
 ",Support multiple homepages via bookmark folder places URI,"since bug 317878 is fixed now, we should be able to implement this.

This isn't completely thought out, since its 5 AM, but here's the general idea:

Maintaining and editing a set of links as multiple homepages is just parallel UI that we really don't want to implement.  The current solution isn't very clear, and requires managing a single textfield in the Options panel.  

What I'm proposing is to make the multiple homepages option an extension of Places, so that users can select a single bookmark or a container (folder, RSS feed, etc) and use that as their homepages, and edits to the bookmark update the homepage, instead of the one-time solution we currently have.  We would also display the bookmark name, instead of the URL (reuse prettyprinting code here if possible).  We could still support arbitrary URLs/no home page, but the idea is that more advanced setups will build on Places and reduce duplicating URIs.

Will the DnD data include the places URI so we can drag a folder?  Other thoughts or bad assumptions I'm making about the nature of Places and the special URIs?"

 ","[UX] The browser should focus the sharing web-app when clicking the overlay's ""Stop Sharing"" button","Note

When the user engages in a video conference, they share their entire screen and navigate through their other applications or windows, if they click the ""Stop Sharing"" button, the browser just removes the permission to share screen and leaves the (maybe) ongoing call in the background.
They might still be sharing a camera and microphone, even if screen-sharing was stopped.
The browser should focus the tab with the still ongoing conference and/or the tab with the actively sharing camera/microphone.

Affected versions

Nightly v78.0a1
Beta v77.0 (RC)

Affected platforms

All

Steps to reproduce
Required prefs:

Flip privacy.webrtc.allowSilencingNotifications to true
Flip privacy.webrtc.legacyGlobalIndicator to false


Engage in a video conference on any WebRTC web-app.
Open a few other random apps/ other windows.
Start sharing your entire screen.
Focus on a different application window or a different browser window.
Click on the ""Stop Sharing"" button from the Global Sharing Overlay.

Expected result

The user is shown the tab with the actively going meeting.

Actual result

The screen sharing permission is removed and the actively going meeting remains in the background

Regression range

This is a feature implementation issue; Not reproducible in Release 76 because the user could not remove his screen-sharing permission if he wasn't on the tab that was sharing it.

To facilitate this, the schemas are published to NPM.

However, the schemas are published as Javascript files, and the server is written in Python.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20051012 Firefox/1.6

If the window width is reduced at some point the visible content won't be fitted
to the window and will be rendered outside the visible window and there is no
way to display it.
Well, hard to describe.

Take a simple webpage like the sample html vom CSS Zengarden. Then reduce the
window width by dragging the right window border to the left. You will see the
text being reformatted while you drag the mouse. On a clean profile the
reformatting stop if the address bar is reduced almost to zero width. If you
then reduce the window width further, the window content will disappear behind
the right window border. And there is no way to get to this content because
there is no scrollbar at the bottom.

The width where the reformatting stops is not fixed. If you remove the search
bar of a new profile the reformatting will stop at a smaller window width. The
bad thing is that this minimum width can also be bigger. With the web developer
extension installed the reformatting stops if the blank space on the web
developer toolbar is reduced to zero. That equals more than half of my desktop
width (1280 pixels), i.e. i can't tile FF next to another window because then
some content won't be visible.

On webpages where there is minimum width implied in the design and where this
minium width is bigger than the width where the reformatting stops, the result
will vary. As soon as the design minimum width is met a scrollbar will be shown.
But sometimes you also can't scroll to the right side enough to see all content

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit page
2. reduce window width

Actual Results:  
reformatting of the page content will stop at a given window width

Expected Results:  
keep reformatting until the window width is limited by the operating system, and
display scrollbar if the content doesn't fit anymore

Both Opera and IE do this correctly. They reformat the page until the window
can't be made smaller anymore (OS limit). If there are long words that can't be
wrapped or pictures, both browsers will display a scrollbar.

Here is a picture: Opera vs. FF trunk: http://free.pages.at/mugros/neth.png
(page is www.nethack.org and i am not using a clean profile, but that doesn't
really matter, and the build was a bit older)

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Histograms.json](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Histograms.json) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in six months.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. MattN is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in six months.

Spec: https://github.com/vtsatskin/FX-Captive-Portals-Design/blob/master/design/spec.md

As part of Firefox's Captive Portal Design, this bug displays a drop-down status bar on all windows and all tabs when a captive portal is detected.  The bar includes a link to the captive portal.  If the user dismisses this bar, it is removed from all open windows and tabs.

Acceptance criteria:

- Drop-down notification displays on all windows and tabs when captive portal is detected
- Drop-down notification contains link to captive portal
- Drop-down notification, when dismissed, is dismissed globally for all windows and tabs and does not reappear unless another captive portal is detected
- If the captive portal is logged into, the drop-down notification disappears from all tabs"

The search box should show the appropriate placeholder text and search icon depending on what the user's current default search engine is.

In order to prevent lag, we can use the following technique to preemptively switch focus to the awesomebar *before* a keystroke is sent. This is similar to Chrome's strategy:

* When the in-content search input is focused, we should immediately shift focus to the awesomebar via message-passing.
* The awesomebar should apply special styling to prevent it from visually appearing focused (use caret-color: transparent; and prevent the outline on :focus from appearing)
* The in-content search should have a fake focus style that applies an outline and fakes a caret with css;
* When the user starts typing in the awesomebar, a message should be sent to content in order to hide the in-content search input
* When the awesomebar is unfocused, a message should be sent to content in order to unhide the in-content search input

"Sync
 ",Integrate Tab Groups data into Session Restore proper,"Right now Tab Candy is using Session Restore to stash data. However this approach is falling short in a few ways:

Undo Close Tab knows nothing about tab sets. So recently closed tabs are shown from all tab sets. This should be local to the current tab set (and stored independently). If we're going to handle this inside session restore, then we need to actually acknowledge that Tab Candy exists & is using session restore for data.

If tab sets become window-independent, then we need to restructure how session data is stored.

Current:
> {
>   ""windows"":[
>     {
>       ""tabs"":[
>         { ... },
>         { ... }
>       ],
>       ""_closedTabs"":[...],
>     }
>   ],
>   ""_closedWindows"":[...]
> }

Proposed (haven't necessarily covered all details)
> {
>   ""tabsets"":[
>     {
>       ""id"":100100101010,
>       ""title"": ""foo"",
>       ""tabs"":[
>         { ... },

I can't look at any of my webpages using Firebird. (See details below.) The same
pages work fine in Mozilla (1.4 released version) and IE (6.0, 5.5, I think even
5.0).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to visit http://members.aol.com/palotay/Scribe.htm (or index.htm, or
Guestbook.htm, or About.htm, or farewell.htm, or spoonhammer.htm... --there are
other pages, but I can't remember their filenames offhand.)

2. Try to look at the default (index) page by typing in
http://members.aol.com/palotay/
Actual Results:  
1. Result: Firebird pops up a window:
   The file ""Scribe.htm"" is of type iso-8859-1 (HyperText Markup Language),
   and Mozilla Firebird does not know how to handle this file type.
It then asks, ""What should Mozilla Firebird do with this file?"" The options are
to open it with the default application, open it with a specified application,
or save it to disk. If you specify Firebird, it downloads the page and opens it
from your Temp folder, which means that none of the stylesheet info is available.

2. Blank page appears, with a big bold error message at the top:
   Can't contact servlet runner at localhost:6704

Expected Results:  
1. Firebird should have opened the webpage, obviously.

2. Every other browser in the universe will know that if you ask for a
directory, you really want the index page the directory contains. (And if there
is no index page, it should either show you the list of files, or if permissions
prevent that, show some sort of 'permission denied' message.) In this case, the
directory contains an index.htm, so that's what should have been displayed.

1. Change control+arrows to do non-contiguous selection. That means we'd need to move the existing tab movement functionality to some other key combinations; e.g. alt+left/right. Not great from a user change perspective, but control+arrows is standard for non-contiguous selection, whereas there's no real standard for movement.
2. Do non-contiguous selection with control+shift+arrows. Not quite as standard, but not unreasonable.
3. Only implement contiguous selection with shift+arrows, but still implement control+space to toggle selection. So, to move to the next tab but exclude it from the selection, you would do shift+rightArrow, control+space. A bit odd, but users could get used to it."

 ",system restarts when closing last firefox window and all personal info lost,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

This is a rather odd issue.  I will be browsing along, minding my own business,
then I call it a night and close down all browser windows.  When I get to that
last window and click the X, my computer screen goes blank and then I am looking
at the startup sequence.  So it causes my system to crash and then reboot.  So
when the computer is  back up, I bring up Firefox and all my bookmarks are gone,
my theme is gone, and the browswer buttons are reset (as I added in a button to
open up a new tab).  What's going on?  And more importantly, how can I fix this?
 Is this just a problem with version 1.0.6?  (as I had this problem before I
reformatted my computer too)  And one last thing, sometimes I click on the icon
to bring up Firefox and it takes a long time to load the program.  Thanks for
your help.

Build ID: 20160623154057

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install Hebrew version of Firefox Developer Edition 49.0a2 (or possibly any RTL version of Firefox having the new design of the URL bar)
2. a. In the URL bar, type ""www.google.com""
   b. In the URL bar, type ""google."" (with a dot after 'google')
3. Observe the first item in the dropdown list, the one having ""Visit"" after the URL and the second with ""Search with Google""


Actual results:

Firefox autocompletes A to ""/http://www.google.com"", and autocompletes B to "".google"" (both being RTL'd)
Notice the '/' and the dot's locations.


Expected results:

A and B should have been ""http://www.google.com/"" and ""google."", respectively.
In short, they should be LTR.

Currently it works okay in 47.0.1 (partially, as the ""Search with Google"" string is incorrectly LTR'd, which is fixed in the new design of the URL bar).

It makes sense for some policies to not be allowed to be used through HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so we should implement a way to annotate policies like that in policies-schema.json, and make the WindowsGPOParser aware of that.

Once that is done, we may even transition the enterprise_only policies to that, and drop the enterprise_only feature.


There's another use case for this: the app updater service can't look for keys under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so the policy to disable app updates needs to be exclusively read from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or the policies.json file"

This will make it easier for developing and migrating, since all the tests will be in the same sub-directories.
Hence I think we should do this.
This is going to be a simple move of just the ones we know about in browser/base/content/test/urlbar.
I'll also rename some of the browser_bugxxxx files so that we have a better idea as to what they are actually testing.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12

It was requested at my Mozilla brown bag talk that I provide a list of interfaces that could be improved to make the browser more flexible about writing state to disk. One of the major issues I ran into was that the file output stream was being referred to by CID instead of contract ID in nsUtils, but that seems to be fixed in Firefox 3. However, I am aware of three additional components that do not have preferences or interfaces suitable to prevent their disk access:

@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1
http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_browsersessionstore1.html
The sessionstore has a number of methods to govern attaching additional information to nodes, but no writeToDisk hook that can be reimplemented to preserve the ""Undo Close Tab"" feature, but prevent browser session from touching disk (or to write it to an alternate location, or encrypt it, etc).

@mozilla.org/dom/storage;1 - http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_domstorage1.html
According to http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage, it seems that DOM  storage is eventually supposed to persist on disk in the event of crashes, yet there are no prefs nor interfaces to govern this. This is probably due to Bug 339445.

@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1
http://xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_cookiemanager1.html
It is possible to disable writing of cookies by demoting the cookie manager's lifetime policy to transform everything into session cookies, however this prevents the implementation of ""memory-only"" cookie jars, or encrypted cookie jars that the user can toggle between without writing them to disk. It may still be possible to do this (with a lot more complicated code) with session cookies and hooking the add method, so perhaps this is a minor concern.

I will add more to this bug as I come across it. The formfill interfaces probably need to be added here, but I have not investigated them in detail yet, since Torbutton just disables formfill and password saving in Tor mode by default for now.

 ",Page action urlbar button ordering can get messed up for new windows,"When you open a new window, BrowserPageActions iterates through all the registered page actions and places them in the window.  The registered actions are ordered according to how they appear in the panel, not the urlbar.  That means that if action A comes before action B in both the panel and the urlbar, placeActionInUrlbar will try to insert A's urlbar node before B's node, but B's node hasn't been created yet.  So B's node is null, so insertBefore() ends up appending A's node to the urlbar.

Steps to reproduce

Launch Firefox and access: https://whereby.com/

Expected result

The Global Sharing Overlay shouldn't be closable or there should be a way for it to be brought back up.

Actual result

The bar is closed and you can't make it appear again on the same call.

Regression range

It's a feature implementation bug.

From dbodea:

This new Global Sharing Indicator cannot be closed on MacOS and this seems to be a correct approach; It can be minimized in the dock, but not closed. Furthermore, the old Global Sharing Indicator can't be closed on Windows either, it can just be dragged on the top of the main screen.
It appears that this issue is also reproducing on Ubuntu 18.04.4LTS.
So this is an issue that occurs on both Windows and Linux OSes, but not on MacOS.
This might need a UX opinion, but the impossibility of closing the Global Sharing Overlay might be the best approach. It is how it was previously designed.

There were 613 from browser.js:4337 (the top callsite). This code looks as follows, and gets called for onLocationChange (so every navigation):

  setOverLink(url, anchorElt) {
    const textToSubURI = Cc[""@mozilla.org/intl/texttosuburi;1""].
                         getService(Ci.nsITextToSubURI);

But the onLocationChange call resets this and passes `""""` for the url. There's no point doing all that work with no URL.

When we do have a URI, we shouldn't continually re-fetch the reference to textToSubURI. Other consumers besides tabbrowser each have their own getter, which seems daft. Let's just add it to Services.jsm."

Today I tried to re-import all my bookmarks in using the JSON backup feature. I made a backup but failed while restoring the bookmarks with the following error message: Unable to process the backup file.

I checked what happens and found that the root cause of this is bug 429350. I have some tags left which don't have any children. Making a backup of such a places file the backup script will stop immediately while writing the data to the json file. Have a look at the attached json file.

While doing the backup following error is shown in the Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception...

The backup script shouldn't fail in such cases when no child nodes are available, no URIs are set or something else. We should always make sure that we write correct backup files otherwise probably lost bookmarks cannot be restored. Perhaps we could also run a syntax check after the creation of the json file?

With standard scaling, and the about:logins page displaying the default content: if the viewport height drops below about 625 pixels, or if the viewport width drops below 1030 pixels, the ""Create New Login"" button gradually gets pushed out of the visible area of the viewport.
With standard scaling, and the about:logins page displaying a saved login on the right side: if the viewport height drops below about 591 pixels, the ""Create New Login"" button gradually gets pushed out of the visible area of the viewport.
Expected results:
The ""Create New Login"" button should always be visible regardless of the content height in the item column.

 ",Focus is immediately grabbed by the AutoComplete/tags or bookmarks suggestion list when you start typing in the awesome bar,"This is a recent regression. When one starts typing, and the list with search engine, tag or bookmark suggestions appears, focus is immediately grabbed (e. g. the first item highlighted) by the autocomplete list. It used to be that one had to explicitly down arrow into the list to take focus off the actual text field. Similarly, when an autofill suggestion appears, and one presses RightArrow to jump to the end of it, focus is not returned to the text field either, so a screen reader user can no longer verify what they typed. Keyboard input might still be accepted by the text field, but because focus sits on the list item within the autocomplete list box, those changes in the text field are no longer observed.

To reproduce:
1. Run Firefox with NVDA.
2. Open a new tab and start typing b u g z (for bugzilla).
3. Two things happen: AutoFill suggests bugzilla.mozilla.org, *and* a list of suggestions appears.

Previously, one could press RightArrow, and the highlight would be taken off the auto-filled text, and cursor placed at the end. *or* one could DownArrow and highlight the first search suggestion.

Now, the first suggestion geets highlighted/focused, and focus control is taken off the text field, so the auto-fill can no longer be used in a controlled fashion. Press right and left Arrow, and you won't hear NVDA announce the characters the cursor moves over."

We would need to pass a separate string for people accessing help using F1. Right now both paths lead to the page/string ""firefox-help"". Maybe we could just add ""firefox-help-f1"" for those selecting help via F1?"

The issue is caused by me trying to fix a previous race condition, where I added some awaits. After these awaits, it then adds the observer. In previous code it wouldn't await and thus the observer would be added right away. If the awaits delay the add observer, it makes calling uninit dangerous. Adding the observer before the awaits makes any uninit calls safe.

I don't see a reason why we cannot just move the add observer line up to before the awaits, to work essentially how it did before, and add a test to ensure the fire order."

It works for feature disabled branch of zero onboarding experiment when we explicitly pass --first-startup flag , however on subsequent startup due to async nature of isFeatureEnabled call, if a user has left about:welcome open in one of the tabs , it will load default welcome first screen instead of showing newtab directly.

 ",Alt+down in location bar searches for original search term rather than selected search term,"I noticed this while working on bug 1330462, and I think it should be somewhat easy to fix, provided we know what it should do.

Steps:

- Type ""corgis"" in the location bar
- Hit the down key until you have a search suggestion selected, like ""corgis near me""
- Hit alt+down, which will let you cycle through one-off search engine buttons, until you're on, say, Bing
- Notice that on the highlighted search suggestion line, it says something like ""corgis near me -- Search with Bing""
- Hit return, and notice that you searched Bing for ""corgis"", and not ""corgis near me""

The same steps in the search bar will result in searching Bind for ""corgis near me."" It seems we missed this bit when adapting the one-off buttons for the location bar. I feel like the best course of action is just to make the location bar match the behavior of the search bar in this regard, no? What seems to be getting in the way is this getter in urlbarBindings.xml:

```
      <property name=""oneOffSearchQuery"">
        <getter><![CDATA[
          // this.textValue may be an autofilled string.  Search only with the
          // portion that the user typed, if any, by preferring the autocomplete
          // controller's searchString (including handleEnterInstance.searchString).
          return (this.handleEnterInstance && this.handleEnterInstance.searchString) ||
                 this.mController.searchString ||
                 this.textValue;
        ]]></getter>
      </property>

I think we can work around this fairly easily so we keep the previous behavior so long as the user hasn't scrolled through the search suggestions."

I have added networked folders to the Bookmarks toolbar.  This works great when
I'm behind my companies Firewall.  But, when I don't have access to these
network folders (i.e.  when i'm at home without VPN access), FireFox will hang
for about 1 minute when it is first opened.  Windows XP reports FireFox as ""Not
Responding.""  After a minute or so, FireFox un-freezes and I can begin browsing
the web.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Right-click on the Bookmarks toolbar and select ""New Bookmark""
2.  Specify the location as a networked folder (i.e.  file://///infinity\myfolder)
3.  Move your computer outside the firewall so you can't access the networked folder
4.  Open FireFox

Actual Results:  
Firefox hanged for about 1 full minute

Expected Results:  
1) The Bookmarks toolbar should have recognized that i can't find the networked
folder and loaded the toolbar

OR

2)  Simply load the toolbar without trying to load the folders contents

This same scenario occurs everytime I click on the Bookmarks menu item because
it also has networked folders linked.  FireFox hangs for a minute"

Steps to reproduce:

Currently the only way to manage policies in the Firefox engine on macOS is to utilize CCK2. Since there was a recent implementation for GPO support on the Policy Engine in Firefox (Bug #1433136), I would like to request similar support for macOS which utilizes Configuration Profiles to manage application preferences. The way to do this is to add support for Firefox to make use of Core Foundation so that when a configuration profile is installed, the application can read the preference values that should be getting enforced. More on Core Foundation here: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/preferences_utilities

Commonly, preferences are written to a plist in macOS which contain the preference values that Core Foundation will read from and then set. This is not required but is the common way in which applications tend to write preferences out which could then be managed by a configuration profile.

Ideally, all the current settings that are manageable with CCK2 would be manageable with a Configuration Profile. However, even just having feature parity with GPO support on Firefox on Windows would be great.


Actual results:

Firefox currently does not store preferences in a plist and does not support Configuration Profiles to enforce preferences.


Expected results:

Firefox currently does not store preferences in a plist and does not support Configuration Profiles to enforce preferences."

I was not aware that deleting items from within the ""recently bookmarked"" menu represented the actual bookmarks themselves. As a result I accidentally hosed about a quarter of my bookmarks in an attempt to clear the list. Hooray for backups so nothing was actually lost. However, other users however might not like the results following a similar strategy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Within the bookmarks menu or manager, navigate to the ""Recently Bookmarked"" item.
2. In a vain attempt to ""clear"" or ""disable"" the ""Recently Bookmarked"" folder, start deleting some familiar recent bookmarks you know the location to.
3. Go find those bookmarks you just deleted in the place they were originally located.
4. Learn they're totally hosed!
Actual Results:  
Bye Bye Bookmarks!

Expected Results:  
I think for the sake of safety, Firefox should populate this folder as a separate list. This way if a user does want to keep the link but not have it appear in their Recently Bookmarked folder, they can safely delete it.

A pref to disable either the display of the folder, collection of recently bookmarked items or a combination of the both would also be ideal here. I'm probably not the only one who might compare this to the windows ""Documents"" start menu item, but even that has an option to safely flush its contents without the actual files and also a power-user add-on to completely disable it. So far I haven't been able to find a pref similar to do either in FF3 RC1."

and infinite window opening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a non-standar file with firebird (for example an .asp file)
2. When ""Open with..."" window appears, browse to select MozillaFirebird and
select to open always with it.
3. Click OK.
4. Make the ""Three finger salute"" and proceed to kill Firebird before your
system collapse.
Actual Results:  
Lots of Firebird windows opened.

Expected Results:  
I'd like Firebird shows file as HTML (or, at last, plain text)

Should be good to have a helper application manager to delete the selection done
and avoid further troubles."

"Security
 ",See if the providers manager or provider base class can manage query lifetimes instead of having every provider subclass do it,"Every provider subclass does something like this:
class ProviderSubclass {
  constructor() {
    // Maps the running queries by queryContext.
    this.queries = new Map();
  }
  async startQuery(queryContext, addCallback) {
    let instance = {};
    this.queries.set(queryContext, instance);
    ...
    this.queries.delete(queryContext);
  }
  cancelQuery(queryContext) {
    this.queries.delete(queryContext);
  }
}

It's not a big deal, but it would be nice if the providers manager or provider base class could take care of managing the lifetime of this.queries and its contents. Then subclasses would only need to access this.queries after they do something async.
We could even abstract that away so that subclasses could call a method like this.queryStillActive(queryContext) after an async operation. That method would be implemented in the base class of course.

 ",Firefox keeps hanging when there's an input or a textarea for input,"I have been noticing that this has been kinda worse as time passes, but only now I think it has stepped over a threshold that is too much to handle.

Problem:
When firefox navigates to a page that includes visible inputs for text (input@type=text, input@type=file or textarea) firefox allocates some extra, quite noticeable, amount of memory. It may hang a bit, but nothing that seem problematic or annoying.

Then, when I try writting something to the textarea or the text inputs it keep hanging and most text I write when it hangs is lost in the input buffer. I need to re-write the text that was not written; and I also need to keep checking if firefox was hanging, or not, while I was writting.


Troubleshooting tries:
I made a clone of my firefox profile and I spent some hours following the guides:
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_hangs
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Standard_diagnostic_-_Firefox

After 3 tries, I restarted the troubleshooting in -safe-mode and did all the rest only in -safe-mode so that the addons + plugins + my changed settings would not interfere with the testing.

Tabs:
I have about 40 tabs open (I don't know the real number) spread through 5 tab groups and with 7 tabs in the current group.

Memory:
I've noticed that, in my normal use, firefox uses between +-900MB (normal state) but can easily escalate to +-1400MB when I'm using textareas, for example.
In -safe-mode, the ""base"" memory was 600-800MB and the peak was +-1100MB

This is information given by the resource manager in the commit tab.

One thing I notice that seems to be happening is that firefox keeps doing heavy GC work over and over. I state that because the memory just keeps on fluctuating and never stays +- still.

Platform:
I'm using win6.1 x64 running on an Intel core 2 duo (does not support hiper-threading).

Possible conflicting software:
I use Ms Security Essentials and I use windows firewall.

How to reproduce:
I don't really know any background steps to reproduce this. Probably the main thing here is to have a ""decent"" number of tabs opened and a computer that is not much powerful and is under a considerable amount of use."
"Firefox Accounts
 ",Changing FxA password via accounts.firefox.com doesn't update keys on that device,"STR:
* Configure Sync on a device.
* On that same device, change your password.

Expected:
* That Firefox doesn't later ask you to again enter your new password to continue syncing.

Actual:
* It does.

A common way to hit this flow is (a) attempt to connect a mobile device, realized you've forgotten your password and reset it, (b) open the ""reset password"" email on your already-configured desktop, (c) set a new password on that device (d) that device later gets upset the password is wrong when syncing.

Rachel hit exactly this (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1085078)

I'm surprised to not find a bug on file for this - did I miss it? I expect that webchannels could help solve this."

 ",Heartbeat: Support heartbeat prompts that target private windows,"Excerpts from bug 1184338:
* PBM users see an opt-in survey. They have divulged no signal to anyone, including Mozilla, that they are in PBM unless they opt-in. 
* Survey prompt offers a link. Clicking the link from PBM launches a survey tailored for PBM or recorded as actual PBM user.
* If a user has both normal and PBM windows open, the tailored survey prompt appears in PBM.
* Heartbeat must respect PBM and store nothing that would indicate what user did in PBM or that they even opened PBM.
* We may need to do work to make Heartbeat less visible. For example, we need to evaluate whether HB fires event callbacks on things like Survey prompt dismissal (""X"")

We can add a private window option to the API:
* which shows the heartbeat UI in the most recent private window (if one exists)
* when the learn more link is clicked, the URL should open in the same private window"

* about:accounts remains in a state where it says verification is still pending.

 ",Keyboard activation (space/enter) of Back/Forward buttons when focused,"When made focusable (for toolbar keyboard navigation), the Back and Forward buttons cannot be activated by pressing space or enter. Although they do have a command event handler, they have type=""menu"", which means the command event is not fired for key presses. Changing this for type=""menu"" is controversial at best, since space should arguably open the menu in this case (and I think it does on the Mac). Because the Back/Forward buttons have a bit of an identity crisis in this respect, I think it's best to just implement keyboard behaviour specifically for these buttons."

If typing either the page up/down keys or hitting the grey areas around the
scrollbar slider with the mouse, the page advances several times, making these
features unusable for page scrolling. It seems that smooth scrolling (which
works as intended for the arrows) is also applied for these elements, which, in the
view of usability, makes no sense at all and therefore is just wrong.
This is very visible for users and should be repaired soon.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a longer page
2.type either the page down key or click into the grey areas below the slider
Actual Results:  
watch the pages flying by, unable to use page up/down for paging document

Expected Results:  
Document should scroll up and down pages one by one to be useful at all.
Don not apply smooth scrolling for page up/down.

This may not be a smooth scrolling problem only, as Mozilla 1.4x has the similar 
problem for the scrollbar areas (often scrolls two pages instead of one, but 
page up-down keys work)."

"Installer
 ",Make Windows installer more 'Unicode-aware',"Currently, our installer on Windows shows garbled strings when the codepage
(character encoding) of an installer is different from the codepage for
'non-Unicode' applications on Windows 2x/XP (and the default system codepage on
Windows 9x/ME). That's because it uses 'A' versions of Windows APIs even when
'W' APIs are available on Win 9x/ME (let alone Win 2k/XP). (e.g. |ExtTextOut|).  

There are two consequences. The first is what's mentioned at the beginning of
this report. The other is that we can't make installers for languages that are
not supported by any of legacy Windows codepages. For instance, Hindi or Tamil
installers can't be made. 

To fix this, we need to replace |ExtTextOut| and alike with the corresponding W
APIs. In addition, translated strings for each localized installer need to be
converted to UTF-8. A trickier part is how to deal with Windows APIs whose 'W'
versions are not available on Windows 9x/ME unless MSLU is present (e.g.
SendMessage). It might be possible to define 'UNICODE' in 'Makefile' or
equivalent and to rely on the fact that MSLU is very likely to be available on
virtually all Windows 9x/ME (even then, we might have to know its location,
which is not  easy)"

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

Although Autocomplete is a very useful, productivity feature, it suffers from
the flaw that too many pages and sites do not set autocomplete=""off"" when
sensitive information such as social security numbers, account numbers, and
credit card numbers are entered. Thus, this allows someone with physical or
remote access to the person's browser to start entering the first couple of
numbers and get the complete number of a credit card social security card, etc.

Although I have tried to some success an evanglism campaign informing webmasters
and web programmers, it has not been that successful. It is hard for normal
users to know how to delete autocompleted entries. 

Ideally, autocomplete should realize that fields with all numbers shouldn't be
autocompleted or saved for autocompletion, especially 9 digit (likely a Social
security number and/or bank routing numbers) and 16 digit (credit card numbers
for Mastercard and Visa).

The fix should also scan for and delete any already existing numerical
autocomplete data that may already be present from the user's profile.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a number representing your credit card number or social security number
in a text field that does not have autocomplete=off set
2. Go to another form and reenter the same data. Firefox will then autocomplete it.

Actual Results:  
Autocomplete works and displays the entire number, even for sensitive numbers,
after a few initial numbers are typed in.

Expected Results:  
Autocomplete should be smart enough to realize that especially 9 and 16 digit
numbers are likely to be extremely senstive and not save or attempt to
autocomplete them.

I am in the United States, banking routing numbers and SSN numbers hence are 9
digits. Telephone numbers, presumably not sensitive, are 10 digits and hence can
be distinquished from the numbers that are especially senstive."

low memory (only 256M installed and running emacs, httpd, named &c), Firefox 0.8
was stable as a rock, but the 1.0 blows up at least once a day.

window or a new tab, for example clicking ""comments"" on an MT blog (opens a
small window) or when selecting a personal linkbar item to display in a new

It is sporadic, or perhaps cummulative; it has never happened very soon after
opening a fresh Firefox, only after visiting several pages, having several

Instead, we should treat a 401 from the tokenserver as a signal to try refreshing our FxA certificate, and only go all the way to ""reconnect"" if that operation fails.  So there's these layers of falling back from auth error:

  * 401 from storage node -> reauth with tokenserver

  * 401 from FxA -> now you really do have to re-enter your password"

The pref would look something like ""pdfjs.AlwaysDisplayNotificationBar"" with default value ""true"". Currently i can hide the bar with custom CSS rule but that disables all notification bars and for obvious reasons is not advisable.

Secondary solution would be to add extra button to the notification bar saying ""This file displayed correctly"" and when user clicks that then the bar dissapears and next time opening the same file the bar is no longer displayed. So essentially it rembembers the user feedback."

 ",Firefox copy URL and email link features should deal with Reader View URLs properly.,"With 57 getting the page action menu, it seems likely that a lot more people are going to be exposed to and use share actions such as Email, Copy, etc. And from a mockup I saw, Reader Mode may be getting even more visibility.

Currently if you attempt to share any page while in Reader View instead of sending the URL you see, you get something like about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdolske.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F05%2F18%2Fphoton-engineering-newsletter-1%2F
This makes for a poor experience for users - and potentially frustrating/confusing experience for recipients. 

When I previously brought up that addons were fetching this internal URL, it was pointed out that this was intentional and addons would have to convert it on their own for user-facing purposes. I doubt any did, but notably *we* didn't do it internally for something like Email (Copy was fixed though).

I've just now seen that the ""Share"" button is disabled in Reader View (don't think it was originally). I'd argue that due to it's increased visibility, this should be enabled for Reader View. As seen in the following mockup, the Share button now seems to pass off URLs straight to the platform's sharing function.
http://i.imgur.com/EYGFt3h.jpg
We can't expect any of these to convert the URL, so let's just convert it for them."

[Steps to reproduce]:

2. In Tab 1 click on video and share selected device and check the permission label in Control Center.
3. In Tab 2 click on video and share selected device and check the permission label in Control Center.
4. Switch to Tab1 and check permission text.
5. In Tab 2 open Control Center and click x closing the camera share then check the permission label in Control Center for tab1.

Step4: The permission text states(tab1): Allow.
Step5: The permission text states(tab1): Allow Temporarily.

[Note1]:
I think that the standard permission status label in use currently  is a bit confusing. In my point of view it it should be like:
Allow temporarily : Allow Once

From 98 release notes (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/98.0/releasenotes/):

Firefox allows users to choose from a number of built-in search engines to set as their default. In this release, some users who had previously configured a default engine might notice their default search engine has changed since Mozilla was unable to secure formal permission to continue including certain search engines in Firefox.

Expected results:
Such behaviour is incorrect from the end use of view. Mozilla should not remove explicitly selected by the use search engine from installed Firefox (especially previously compiled from the source code).
Mozilla could remove search engine if it's not selected/used by the end user.

Tbis is a dupe of http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75138 (for
Mozilla).  There's a great discussion of it over there.  However, that RFE has
been listed for over a year now and is still marked for ""future"".

I think this feature would be important.  I, myself, prefer links to open new
windows.  Others would prefer them to use an existing window.  Now that you can
also browse with tabs, other people might like a combination of the two (open a
new tab in an existing window).

Right now it's pretty much random for me.  Some applications open links in a new
window while others seem to always use the top most window.  However, I think
it's important that opening new links be consitant.  I can't get all of my
applications to do the same thing, so it's logical that I should be able to set
my browser to act only one way.

I would like to open up this enhancement for Phoenix since (I think) the
developers of Phoenix can add features independant of Mozilla.  However, I'll
understand it if you feel this isn't that important.  At least you will have
considered it.

To be specific, it corrupts the NTUSER.DAT file that is in a user's home directory. The sequence of events is as follows:

1. My laptop is running fine, reboot after reboot.

2. One day, I start my laptop and, without doing anything else, open the Firefox browser, click Menu -> Help -> About Firefox.

3. Firefox automatically checks if an update is available. It turns out, there is an update, so it asks me to restart the browser to finish the update.

4. I restart the browser and check the FF version. It has updated from the previous version 50.0.2 to the new version 50.0.4. I then Exit the browser. (I do not have any Extensions/Plug-ins installed in FF).

5. After this I do absolutely nothing else on my laptop and shut it down. The next time I restart the laptop and try to log into the User Account that was used to update FF, it turns out, my Windows User Profile has been corrupted.

6. Windows logs me on with a temporary profile with the message:
""You have been logged on with a temporary profile. You cannot access your files and files created in this profile will be deleted when you log off...."" (see the screenshot)

7. I log out and check other User Accounts on my laptop and they are all working fine.

Luckily, I happen to have a backup (uncorrupted) copy of the NTUSER.DAT file. So I replace the corrupted NTUSER.DAT file with the backup copy. This fixes the problem in a way and I am back into my user account as per the backed-up profile settings.

How come I had a backup copy of the NTUSER.DAT file? Well guess what! The above problem has been occurring repeatedly since around late October 2017. It absolutely wrecked my life (User Profile got corrupted several times). Only after wasting days and weeks trying to search for a solution, I learnt it was the NTUSER.DAT file that was getting corrupted and that I ought to keep a good copy of that file from now on.

Each time this happened, I can now recall I had updated the Firefox browser.

Another user seems to have reported a similar bug earlier, though under different circumstances:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1300738

In that post, someone mentioned the Avira Antivirus as a possible reason. But I don't have Avira!


Actual results:

The NTUSER.DAT file in the user's home directory (Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit) gets corrupted after running Firefox update and the user cannot log into Windows.


Expected results:

The Windows User Profile should not have been corrupted."

I wonder if it should be a ""related tab"" so that the Protections Report opens in a tab right next to original tab instead of at the end of the tab bar.
However, we also have access to the Protections Report via the hamburger/application menu.  When you click on the Report there, a regular tab makes sense.
Having different behaviors for the two scenarios is not ideal.  But showing the report at the end of the tab bar is also not ideal.

"Downloads Panel
 ",Importance of maintaining the same GET parameters while fetching a collection using an offset,"After receiving an offset token while batching downloads, how should clients treat subsequent requests? Should they make an effort to maintain the same `since`, `order`, and `limit` parameters? Or is it possible to, say, maintain the same `since` value but change a `limit` parameter on a subsequent request, and expect it to be respected?

Example: there are 30 records in total to fetch.
- 1) since=1&limit=10. We get back something like offset=10.
- 2) since=1&offset=10&limit=50 - will the new limit be respected?
- 2.1) what if instead we reduced our limit? since=1&offset=10&limit=5 ? what should be expected to happen?

Docs currently seem to be somewhat ambiguous on the subject.

Context for this is the ""resume incremental sync where we left off"" work as part of Bug 1291821. If a sync is interrupted for a non-412 reason, we'd like to resume it at some point in the future in the most optimal way. Ideally, by re-using whatever offset token we had previously. Client's per-batch limits might change over time, as may other parameters. Primary example I can think of is an application update which changes per-batch limits. If this update also interrupts a sync-in-progress, the client needs to either maintain more state, reset and fetch more records than necessary, or be certain that its new request (with an old offset and new limit, for example) will be respected.

May an `order` change during batching downloads? Does this make sense at all, or should a client just reset its state and ""try again""? What about other parameters that one might specify such as ""ids"" and ""full""? 

To quote rnewman from IRC, ""I would be happy to see either consistent definition used: either all other parameters are ignored (i.e., the offset is a continuation token for a pickled query) or 'since' and order etc. must be the same, and limit can change and will be respected (i.e., the offset is either an offset or a reference to a server-side cursor that can be read from in smaller or larger chunks); in either case, the client can safely use a different limit and something sensible will happen"".

How do the two sync servers handle the `offset` now?"

 ",v98 Downloads panel pops up incorrectly when opening files as pages in Firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/98.0
Steps to reproduce:
The new and improved Downloads panel in v98 is advertised as:
This means you??梨?experience minimal interruptions and easily find your downloaded files.
The current implementation must be erroneous as it results in the exact opposite: the panel shows up when it should not, in an extremely disruptive fashion, and the system Downloads folder is polluted with files that should not be there.
Actual results:
Under ""Files and Application Settings"", I have selected ""Always ask you where to save files"", and for the vast majority of the individual files associations, I have ""Always ask"" as the action on download.
Vast majority of ""downloads"" that I do are the PDF files I work with daily.
When clicking on a link that serves a PDF, I am always presented with a dialog - open in Firefox, save to disk, open in Adobe. That part is correct. I do need the dialog, as half of the time I want to ""Open in Firefox"" and another half - ""Save to disk"".
Starting with v98, after I select ""Open in Firefox"", the PDF opens as a page in Firefox, and then two things erroneously happen:

The Downloads panel pops up and shows the file name being downloaded
The PDF file that I now have opened as a page saves into my system Downloads folder, effectively turning it into the Temp folder. (As I have noted above, I do not have the Downloads folder set as my default destination, I have ""Always ask where to save files"", so putting any file at all automatically into the system ""Downloads"" folder is erroneous behaviour.)

So each and every time, after opening a PDF in Firefox, I have to 1) Close the useless Downloads popup, and 2) Locate the unwanted file in the Downloads folder and delete it (which may be really tricky given the nonsensical names, often GUIDs).
I literally spent half of today fighting the Downloads panel that kept appearing on each PDF view. I can testify that it is a major annoyance and goes very much against the entire experience of ""open in Firefox"", where the file opens as if it was but another web page.
Expected results:
When the downloaded file is ""Opened in Firefox"" (e.g. a PDF):

The Downloads panel should not show up
The file should not be automatically saved into the system Downloads folder

When the downloaded file is ""Saved to disk"" into a user-provided folder:

The Downloads panel should not show up (it's simply pointless - I have just manually selected a folder to save the file, I don't need to be immediately told what folder I just selected)

The behavior is that the window minimizes to the TaskBar, but it doesn't crash in itself. But you're unable to use alt-tab to bring Minefield to the foreground again, or press right-click to un-minimize or to close the application. All you can do is to kill it with the TaskManager.

The build from yesterday (2007112805) behaves correctly (I downloaded the full installer form yesterday and today to rule out problems during auto-update). I have no BreakPad logs, since it wasn't a real crash."

Q5 should include a list of the measurements being added. In this case it would name and describe `uptake.remotecontent.result.uptake.{remotesettings|normandy}`'s extra key `errorName`. Specific information that's important is if this has a limited possible list of values or if the string could be anything at all.

Q6 requires that an individual be named as responsible for this collection if it is to be a permanent collection. In cases of expanded collection it's usually the same person responsible for the rest of the collection.

Q8 requires a response. (In this case I believe Firefox's Data Choices setting controls it as it's Telemetry)"

"Sync
 ","Add a ""PlacesSyncUtils"" module and refactor the bookmarks engine to use it","Sync currently uses the synchronous methods exposed by `nsINavBookmarksService` and friends. In bug 1258127, we're looking to add a ""syncChangeCounter"" field to Places, and increment it for every tracked change. We don't want for Sync to track its own changes, though, except when we reconcile an incoming bookmark with existing local changes.

I'm thinking we could add a ""PlacesSyncUtils"" module that provides queries specifically for Sync. These could use transactions to update multiple tables at once: for example, to set tags or annos. Sync would pass an ""info"" object (similar to Bookmarks.jsm), and Places would take care of the queries.

There is precedent for this in https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Places/AsyncAPIsForSync; in fact, I think that was one of the reasons for creating Bookmarks.jsm! I imagine these would share queries; the only differences are: 1) additional fields, like keywords, tags, and annos, and 2) no change counter increments.

This work can be done independently of bug 1258127. If we do this first, bug 1258127 would change these calls to skip the change counter, without changing the public API. That would make the migration a lot easier than trying to do everything in that bug.

I'm definitely open to other, less invasive suggestions, too. :-) Maybe some kind of ""cookie"" that we can pass to the Places methods, that would tell it to skip the counter? I'm only suggesting this approach because it's come up before, so maybe now's the right time for it."

 ","Firefox doesn't enter ""needs reauthentication"" state after 401 getting a certificate during a sync","If we get a 401 fetching an initial token before we sync everything acts correctly. However, subsequent 401s hitting /certificate/sign will *not* enter needs-reauthenication state until the browser is restarted. This means that in this case the browser is silently failing to sync without the user being aware.

I simulated this with a simple patch which is below. It appears that sync isn't sending the notifications browser-fxaccounts expects to see to update the state. Adding ""weave:service:sync:error"" to the list of observers that cause us to update the UI appears would fix it.

patch against 50, which also requires the pref services.sync.debug.ignoreCachedAuthCredentials to be set to true (the hard-coded 7 is roughly how many token fetches will be done such that sync is actually running when the failure is simulated)

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Scalars.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Scalars.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 85.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :agashlin is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 85.

Firefox crashes on URL load. This is intermittent and not specific to any URL, but usually after several days of the browser being open. By the time it crashes, Firefox is running very slowly and usually has over 2GBs of memory in use.

See attached crash logs from 5/8/09 and 5/10/09.

No Firefox Crash Reporter activates ever. 10% of the time Apple Crash Reporter activates.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Leave browser open for several days under active use with at least 200 tabs in use. Browser will eventually crash. No specific reproduction steps, although as a side note, loading extremely large images tends to increase instability of browser and cause it to crash faster (as observed by tab load time, rainbow wheel occurrence, text field typing issues, and flash video playback pauses).
Actual Results:  
Software crashes, often with no crash dialog; occasionally with Apple Crash Dialog. Never with Firefox Crash Dialog.

Expected Results:  
Software should not crash; and when it does, Firefox Crash Dialog should open.

 ",Need to block chrome URLS when we block about: URLs,"This is a clone of the previous bug specifically to fix in 62 and beyond due to Content policy changes.


+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1453012 +++

We currently block about: URLS in the redirector, but these can be bypassed by typing the chrome URL directly in the URL bar (chrome://global/content/config.xul).

We need some mechanism to block that as well.

For 60, maybe we should just have the JS files for the various feature bail early if the policy is not enabled?

While we think of a longer term solution?

 ",[Firefox] [PDF Viewer] Firefox can't handle write-protected PDF files correctly,"This is reported by a user in the SUMO forums:
https://support.mozilla.org/pt-BR/questions/966691

STEPS TO REPLICATE:
Open a PDF which has an Owner password, but the User password is left blank. This should give the user permission to View and Print the PDF.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
According to the user, the file should open automatically for Viewing and/or Printing, without being prompted for a password.

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR:
When using Firefox, the user is prompted for a password when opening this file.

If the user changes the internal PDF viewer to the Adobe plugin it works perfectly (as it does in Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE)

I am requesting a copy of the password-protected PDF to help investigate the issue.

Please let me know if there are any questions, or if there is anything else that I should ask the user.

Thanks!!

28 x 28 px - after landing patch from bug #1377184

36 x 26 px - after landing patch from bug #1377184
28 x 28 px - in Photon specification

Space between Tab and ""Open a new tab"" button:
4 px - after landing patch from bug #1377184

 ",Problem(s) with delayed key handling in urlbar,"I'm investigating why browser/base/content/test/urlbar/browser_autocomplete_enter_race.js fails when the Gecko timer precision changed to 2ms.  Info here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqND7I0Z_C8k8qx6hQNIDxbHRq3lBP6e1BKTrI3e3yk/edit#heading=h.a3ayihnys1gi

There are failures in two of the test tasks.  I haven't looked at the second in depth yet, but the first is a real problem in Firefox, not a test problem.  (My initial impression is that the second is, too.)  It's that test_keyword hangs because we end up never replaying a deferred keypress.  It looks like it's because when the replay timeout fires, the age calculation used to tell whether a deferred keypress is old enough to replay is slightly off.  i.e., at the point that the timeout fires, the age should be <= the period of the timeout, but it's > instead.  The timeout is never restarted, so the deferred keypress is never handled.

This kind of failure -- where we're using Date.now() to calculate an age and we're using timeouts -- is definitely plausible given this change in Gecko timers.  It might be enough to make sure the replay timeout keeps going as long as there are deferred keypresses.  But I'd like to go back and re-evaluate why we have this ferring mechanism at all so that we could ideally get rid of it.  The general deferred-keypress mechanism grew out of the older deferred-enter-key mechansim, which looks like was introduced here: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/6c9f72338190

Users on other platforms get the same ads, of course, but we mostly hear from the Mac users. On MacOSX these dialogs are ""sheets"" that slide out of our chrome like an infobar, and contain a big, prominent Firefox logo that seems to overwhelm any clarifying message we're trying to send with the ""The site XXXX says"" text.

Maybe we want to re-evaluate the dialog textual changes that were made in FF2 (""The site at xxxx says..."") and see if that's working on all platforms (should it be bold? bigger? can we even do that given the frozen prompt interface?) and I think I saw another bug or discussion on that. But at the very least we should remove the prominent Firefox logo-of-approval from the mac prompts and replace it with platform-appropriate generic icons (or even nothing).

Sometimes (always, it seems) when I open bookmark panel, its fields (namely ""Name"", ""Folder"", ""Tags"") update after the panel is shown, causing distracting text movement.
These 2 scenarios demonstrate the bug

First:
1. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479 in a new (""first"") tab, bookmark it with name ""1"".
2. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1344309 in a new (""second"") tab, bookmark it.
3. Assuming that the last time you opened bookmark panel in ""second"" tab, switch to ""first"" tab and press Ctrl+D.

Result: In the field ""Name"" the name of the 2nd bookmark is briefly displayed, but then it's replaced with ""1""
Expected: All fields should initially display information related to current page


Second:
1. Open new window, open url https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479#1029392

it works perfect.

Firefox randomly stops responding after attempting to open a link.  Firefox will attempt to access a link, and after about 10 seconds the status bar stops showing any progress and then blanks out and/or says ""Stopped"".  Afterwards CPU usage skyrockets to 100% and when it gets near impossible to close Firefox.  If I do manage to close it manually, Windows XP will say the process is not responding.  If I click End Task and check the Task Manager, there is a zombie firefox.exe process taking up loads of RAM.  This happened after I updated to 2.0.0.5, AND DOES NOT RESOLVE ITSELF EVEN IF I DOWNGRADE TO 2.0.0.3 or 2.0.0.4.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a webpage.
2. Open a random link, but try to open the link as quickly as possible.
3. Firefox will hang and/or any new attempts at visiting other sites fail until Firefox is restarted.

Since I updated my Mac with the latest updates from Tuesday, and Wednesday this week (Mar. 19, 20), Firefox becomes unresponsive after a period of time.  This does not seem to be linked to any particular URL, or to any particular action.  Since I noticed it today, it may be related to the last update Time Machine and AirPort Updates.  I did notice on one of my Macs (MacBook Pro) that installing this update changed the setting for Configure Settings to Access the Internet.  I had to put it back to Auto-Detect.  But, this did not happen on two other Macs.  The hanging has occurred on two of the Macs, and I have to use Force Quit to quit Firefox.  Sometimes it does not happen for an hour, and other times it happens every few minutes.  Clearly, something in the updates is conflicting with something in Firefox.

"Address Bar
 ",Consider reuploading inconsistent bookmarks immediately after a sync,"The new bookmarks engine moves orphans to `unfiled`, doesn't check for `parentid` mismatches, and ignores issues like tombstoned GUIDs showing up in a folder's `children`. This was a compromise to match the old Desktop bookmarks engine, which does the same thing.

In theory, this is OK: we'll ignore deleted children, and, when we eventually see the missing parent, we'll move the orphan into it.

In practice, this can backfire if we also have local changes to unfiled. For example, if we've added a new bookmark A to unfiled locally, then see an incoming orphan B, we'll upload a record for unfiled that has A and B as children, even though B's real parent is one we haven't seen yet. B's `parentid` points to the real parent, but the new engine ignores `parentid`, and relies on the parent's `children`...so, when another new Desktop syncs, it'll think that B's real parent is unfiled.

I think Fennec will also try to reupload `unfiled`, but not B, to match its view of the world, but I'm not sure.

Some ideas:

1. Do nothing, at least for now. What we have now might be OK for most cases, and we can think about revisiting this once we have a shared sync implementation.

2. Leave orphans unmerged, keeping them out of the merged tree entirely. This quickly gets hairy: now the orphan doesn't appear to exist at all, we've intentionally diverged from the server, and the user doesn't know why the bookmark they added isn't showing up. Also, what happens if we moved an existing item between two folders, and failed to upload the new parent? That item is now an orphan, but already exists in the tree! Should we delete it and leave it unmerged in the mirror?

3. Flag the bookmark for (weak?) reupload, maybe in a separate batch. (We used to do separate batches, for one notion of weak uploads, but dropped that in bug 1337978, comment 23).

Now we've made the server and other clients consistent, albeit wrong. Batch uploads should make this less common, though my intuition is that it can still happen on a large first sync, where we split records up into multiple batches.

The benefit of (3) is that it's easy for the user to notice and fix, since that order will be wrong _everywhere_, instead of just one or some of their devices. They'll see their bookmarks aren't in the right place, and move them back, after giving Firefox the side-eye. >.>

The danger is getting into a sync loop, where each client thinks its structure is authoritative, and goes back and forth reuploading the same records. This would be even harder for the user to detect and fix. If Sync also undoes their attempt to move their bookmarks back to the right place, we'll be worse off than we are now.

Maybe the right thing to do here is a mix of 1 and 3? Wait until we have a single bookmark syncing implementation, then reupload inconsistent bookmarks, and force everyone to do a full sync to take care of inconsistencies already on the server. The advantage of doing this sooner is that everyone will need to do a full sync when we turn new bookmarks on, anyway. But maybe we can't do this safely yet."

Build ID: 20130215130331

Steps to reproduce:

I just opend a usual PDF.


Actual results:

There is a massive problem with the integrated pdf viewer of firefox 19. I just wondered why ALL my pdf's i ever uploaded (and there are many, i am webdesigner) was shown as hieroglyphs, while the pdf's itself are alright.

For this i can show an example:
http://messe-fsg.de/wp/wp-content/uploads/Ausstellerliste-PAN-2012.pdf
(created with Corel Draw pdf creator)

Should be displayed like this:
http://messe-fsg.de/wp/wp-content/uploads/Ausstellerliste-EGG-2013.pdf
(Created with Adobe Acrobat Distiller)

I tryed some things out and the integrated viewer works if i create the pdf with Adobe Acrobat. But if i use Corel Draw X6 for example there are only hieroglyphs...
In case of other PDF creating programms the viewer shows the PDFs extremly slow.
(dont know if that is important, but its german language and there are ""umlaute"" included)


Expected results:

Just display the pdf like the adbe reader or another pdf viewer."

 ",Implement blocking system for special search shortcut top sites,"The following blocking behaviour applies to the special search shortcut top sites:
1. Once the places query for top sites returns all links, find any link with hostname `amazon` or `google` and change it to be `www.amazon.com` or `www.google.com` or some generic amazon and google link that we decide
2. When blocking the special search shortcut top site via 'Dismiss' option in context menu, it blocks the generic version of the link associated with the special search shortcut top site, so that next time, any amazon/google link that comes out of places organically gets changed to it's generic link version via step 1, and will get filtered out. This results in never showing another special search shortcut top site for that provider

The idea here is that instead of showing, for example an amazon top site, it'll *always* show the special search shortcut, unless the user has attempted to block the special search shortcut tile, in which case we never show any amazon links, and we never show the special search shortcut tile either. If they have blocked the special search shortcut tile, it's a good indicator that they never want to see a tile of that sort again. If they want to see an amazon link again, they can add it manually using the 'add a top site' functionality.

Nightly 63.0a1

[Affected platforms]:
Windows 10 x64, Mac OS X 10.13, Ubuntu 18.04 x64

[Prerequisites]:
- set the pref dom.payments.request.enabled to ""true""
- use a profile with saved cards

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Go to ???챫ps://rsolomakhin.github.io/pr/expl/??and click on ???쉤??button
2. Select a saved shipping address and payment method
3. Check if the shipping option is pre-selected with ??0.00 Standrd shipping??4. Fill in the CVV code and click on ??耳쪅??
[Expected Result]:
The response for the test should correctly reflect the shipping option as ""shippingOption"": standard.


[Actual Result]:

 ",Honour the exception list for tracking protection in the exact same way that we used to up to and including in Firefox 62,"STR:

1. Enable blocking all detected trackers always by going to Content Blocking in Preferences, selected Always under Trackers.
2. Open www.reddit.com in a new non-private window.
3. From the Control Centre, select Disable Blocking For This Site.
4. Open a private window, and load www.reddit.com there as well.

Actual results:

  * Trackers aren't blocked in the private window (no messages indicating any trackers are blocked gets logged to the browser console.)


Expected results:

  * Trackers should be blocked in the private window.

5. Remove the exception added in step 3 by clicking that button again.
6. Now in the private window, add an exception for reddit by following a similar instruction to step 3.
7. Reload the non-private tab.

Actual results:

  * Trackers aren't blocked in the non-private window (no messages indicating any trackers are blocked gets logged to the browser console.)

Expected results:

  * Trackers should be blocked in the non-private window.



In very simple terms, before this regression, the exception lists used to be checked independently, the normal list for normal windows and the private list for private windows.  After the regression, we are checking both lists for both types of windows."

 ",Turn on Insecure Password Warning in Firefox Release,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1301772 +++

This bug is to move the Insecure Password Warning (in the URL bar) to release from beta. (follow-on from Bug #1301772)

Because the change is relatively low risk (from a user perspective), particularly now that Chrome will also be shipping something similar in January, we feel like we are in a good place to move to release.

The stronger UI (in context, which is a number of the child bugs under Bug #1217142) will go through some testing (via Heartbeat) first to ensure it does as intended.

The strategy for getting more developers to move to HTTPS is as follows:
- Do a Heartbeat study on how users would perceive the in-context insecure password UI
- Publish the results of that study, targeted at developers (encouraging them to move to HTTPS) and a description of the changes that are coming
- Roll out this (more minor) change in v51
- In a future release, roll out the in-context UI changes"

Platforms: ALL
[Steps to reproduce]:

Open the Firefox browser and reach https://edition.cnn.com/videos
Open the Site info Panel and Allow Autoplay media with sound.
Check the Preferences > Permissions > Exceptions list for Autoplay media with sound (Cnn.com is added with the Allow status)
In the Previous tab Reach the site info panel and Block the Autoplay media with sound
Reach  Preferences > Permissions > Exceptions list for Autoplay media with sound

Expected Result:
The Site info panel should change the status of the domain from ALLOW to BLOCK  in the Preferences > Permissions > Exceptions list for Autoplay media with sound
Actual Results:
The Previously added Domain with the ALLOW status is completely removed instead of changing its status to Blocked

"Session Restore
 ",Support undoing closeTab and closeWindow by ID,"undoCloseTab and undoCloseWindow in SessionStore.jsm require an index to be passed into them that represents the current index of the tab or window in the SessionStore data. This creates an issue when one would like to query SessionStore and then later request that a window or tab be restored (because the index could have changed).

Our suggested solution to this is to create and store a unique ID for each closed tab and window in SessionStore, and then allow a consumer to query by ID to find the current index of the tab or window.

This would introduce a function into SessionStore.jsm along the lines of:

getUndoIndexById(id, type), where type is either window or tab

A consumer could then call, for example:

undoClosedWindow(getUndoIndexById(id, ""window""))"

Expected results:

It seems odd that the Firefox logo appears from the X. It looks like a flaw. Image attached.

"Keyboard Navigation
 ",Should be able to create smart keywords for searches that use HTTP POST,"Currently we can only do %s substitution on keywords created using URLs that use
HTTP GET via http://www.foo.com/bar.cgi?q=%s

The number of HTTP POST search engines is fairly large significant and it'd be
worthwhile supporting that too. This requires some modifications to bookmarks
and the browser, specifically...

Add a new field to bookmarks: 

POSTDATA=""prop1=val1<CRLF>prop2=val2<CRLF>prop3=%s<CRLF>""

%s is used (again) to designate the section to be substituted by the user value.

The code in browser's getShortcutOrURL is then structured like this:

function getShortcutOrURL (aPostDataRef) 
{
  if (!bookmarks.resolveKeyword(aPotentialKeywordURL)) {
    // look for "" "" in URL
    // chop keyword off the start
    var keywordURL = bookmarks.resolveKeyword(keyword);
    if (keywordURL && userValue) {
      if (bookmark has postdata)
        aPostDataRef.value = getPostData(postdata, keyword);
      else
        // replace %s in keywordURL with keyword
    }
  }
}

function getPostData(aStringData, aKeyword)
{
  var dataStream = Components.classes[""@mozilla.org/io/string-input-stream;1""]
                            .createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIStringStream);
  // replace %s in aStringData with aKeyword
  dataStream.setData(aStringData, aStringData.length);

  var mimeStream = Components.classes[""@mozilla.org/network/mime-input-stream;1""]
                           
.createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIMIMEInputStream);
  mimeStream.addHeader(""Content-Type"", ""text/plain"");
  mimeStream.addContentLength = true;
  mimeStream.setData(dataStream);
  return mimeStream.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIInputStream);
}

The ""Add Smart Keyword..."" menu item can then be shown for the following cases:

- method attribute unspecified
- method=""GET""
- method=""POST"" and
  - enctype attribute unspecified
  - enctype=""text/plain"""

Steps to reproduce:

0) Create a new profile in current nightly (2018-02-04).
1) Add the following search engine:

</SearchPlugin>

2) Set ""about:newtab"" as Home Page in Preferences -> General
3) Restart
4) Start Network Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+E) to observe network requests.
5) Enter any search term in the awesome bar and search with the added ""StartPage"" search engine.
6) Do another search in the same way.


Actual results:

The first request is (incorrectly) sent as GET to https://www.startpage.com/do/search
This request gets redirected to https://www.startpage.com/ because it has no search parameters set.

The second request is correctly sent as POST with the ""query"" parameter set to the search terms. This results in a proper web search.



Expected results:

The first request should have been a POST request with the proper parameters set."

 ",firefox 1.0 crashes often in win2000 on a p4 w/o hyper threading,"ok so this isn't EXACTLY a bug, per se.

but i have noticed that firefox 1.0 likes to crash more often than previous
releases. so i was thinking that it would be pretty cool if firefox could save
browser state every so often, at a configurable interval.

ie: you set a time limit and every time it passes, the browser saves the urls to
all open tabs to a file. 

this would alleviate a lot of pain. i do a lot of research via the internet at
work, and i adore firefox, but when it crashes while i am comparing three or
four documents or reference materials, it makes me mad.

but if the browser saved state, either through a menu option, keyboard shortcut,
or automagically, this could all be avoided.

and i can't imaging i'm the first to think of this.

it would be yet another thing firefox holds over the competition.

and i must say it is the only thing i have ever wanted for in the browser.
besides this, it performs amazingly. it has been deployed across our entire
organization."

 ",Copy for string  changes to DNT dialog,"This bug can be used to decide on the new string to use the the DNT dialog.

Some options:
When tracking protection is on, Firefox will send the DNT header.
The DNT header is sent when Tracking Protection is enabled.
When Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent.
Whenever Tracking Protection is enabled, the DNT header is sent.

We could potentially add a ""Note:"" at the beginning of the string.

The last string uses ""whenever"" to indicate that if Tracking Protection is just on in Private Browsing mode, then the DNT isn't sent automatically in regular mode.

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1274654 +++

When TP is enabled, the DNT header is going to be sent per bug 1258033.

In order to communicate this to users, we need to make changes to the dialog that pops up when you click about:preferences#privacy ""manage your DNT settings"".  If TP is enabled globally, the DNT checkbox should be checked and grayed out so that the user can't uncheck it.  In addition, there should be some messaging to indicate that DNT is automatically turned on when TP is on.  There was a previous mockup for this here:

https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/QS7DW14A2#/screens/117954448_Dnt_State_2

Proposed string from previous mockup:
When tracking protection is always on, Firefox will send the DNT header.

The above works when TP is enabled globally.  I'm not sure how we communicate that DNT is sent in private browsing mode."

"General
 ",[Interventions] Open user survey web pages in certain scenarios,"From an email:

I met DS and survey folks on Friday to discuss the survey for Interventions, and they have a few asks for the survey.
Timing
They've asked that we trigger the survey directly after the user types one of the identified searches.  Since we're already recording event telemetry on each of the control and variant branches, I hope we can do this relatively easily.
Survey groups
They've asked that we show the survey to users in three distinct cases:
Treatment: When they engage with an intervention
Treatment: When they are shown an intervention but ignore it
Control: When they would have seen an intervention but we didn't show it
Survey group size
We need to aim for 250+ responses per survey group to get useful results.  Typically we'll get about 2% of users to respond to a survey, so that means we'll need to get at least 12500 users to click on an intervention.   We'll see how the experiment goes, but we can keep it running if we don't get enough results.
As the first case will be the least common, we'll probably want to prompt 100% of the time.  For the other cases, we'll want to randomly sample so we get about the same number of surveys in each group.  As an example we think we'll see a CTR of 2%, we should survey about 2% of the other groups to keep it balanced.  We don't need to be perfect here, we just need to make sure we hit 250+ without over-surveying the second and third groups.

To implement, the add-on needs to know the URLs to open. Related:

Usually we pass in a value via URL param that tells the platform which branch the user was in.

To implement the ""random sample"" part for the other two cases, the add-on needs to know the number of users in the experiment.

It's like session restore doesn't notice that I had closed it and keeps trying to bring it back every time I restore. I can reproduce this quite regularly with my current session. If I make sure I don't have the history sidebar open, let Firefox sit for a bit while I do other stuff in order to make sure it saves a session, and then `killall -9 firefox-bin` to force close, the next restore will still have the history sidebar open. ;(

When viewing certain PDF's using the default PDF viewer in Firefox 19 and 20 a blue bar appears above the PDF saying This PDF document might not be displayed correctly giving the user an option to open with a different viewer. The problem is that only 1/2 the PDF displays and unless the user decides to click on Open with Different Viewer to compare the results they are left with missing information.  

It appears to be an issue with PDF's that have text typed on them using Acrobats typewriter tool. Everything typed on the PDF using the typewriter tool is completely missing but the rest of the PDF gets displayed.

"Tours
 ","Add a ""reason"" field to collection_changed messages","Every time a new device joins the Sync account, after the first upload of our own client record, we ask the FxA server to send a ""collection_changed"" push message. (bugs 1372655 1372657).
We do this to inform other clients that they should refresh their devices list immediately, so we can send tabs to that new device right away.

The problem is that we send the exact same ""collection_changed"" push message when we send a tab to another device.
iOS assumes that ""collection_changed"" == ""tabs sent to me"", which means in the first case it will show a blank notification, because there's no received tab to be found.

There's a few solutions to fix that problem:
- Alter the current ""collection_changed"" push message [0] to add a ""reason"" field (""sendtab"", ""newdevice""). On FxA, block the push messages sent to iOS that have the ""newdevice"" reason.
- On iOS, if a ""collection_changed"" message is received without a corresponding tab, show ""A new device has connected"". This is pretty bad: it can be very inaccurate and we already show a similar message when we receive device_connected.
- Send a completely different push message to send tabs to devices. This is the nuclear solution.

Any other ideas?

"Security
 ",Pocket Audience Estimation Via Differential Privacy,"Request for data collection review form
All questions are mandatory. You must receive review from a data steward peer on your responses to these questions before shipping new data collection.

What questions will you answer with this data?

Pocket is looking to understand Firefox users in order to improve personalized
content recommendations. These recommendations come in two flavors: organic and
sponsored. While organic content is provided to build good will and a nice
user experience, sponsored content is provided by advertisers wishing to reach
a specific audience. Currently, we can only provide information about audience
reach after running the content. This isn't a very good situation potential
advertisers as they have essentially make purchases sight-unseen.
Additionally, the current personalization methods in ActivityStream in are
dependent on a user's browse history, which we can not observe. Instead, we're
force to treat the system as a bit of a black box, because we can only observe
the final rankings without having understanding where personalization is
working well, and were it is not. By collecting data about the broad interests
of users, we can not only provide a better experience for advertisers, but also
better understand how personalization is performing in practice.

Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions?  Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements?

By collecting this data, we can better understand how sponsored content should
be targeted to users, understand how many people an advertising campaign could
reach, and better understand how to personalize content based on a user's
interests in order to provide a more engaging Activity Stream / Firefox Home
experience.
Improving advertising relevance should help Pocket, and Mozilla, support its
revenue centric OKR.

What alternative methods did you consider to answer these questions? Why were they not sufficient?

For judging personalization performance in general, we currently use aggregate
response metrics such as CTR, but trying to make improvements based on user
interests is a bit troublesome, as we do not currently understand how distinct
the users are from each other. We also don't understand if our interest models
properly match a user's interests, as we can't observe the data we're using to
determine the interests.
For sponsored content, we can only gather information about an audience after
the campaign is run. This is a suboptimal experience for advertisers, as we
currently can only answer the most basic questions about their campaigns, prior
to launch.

Can current instrumentation answer these questions?

There is no current method for sending back information about a user's interests
and broadly what type of sites they visit on the web.

List all proposed measurements and indicate the category of data collection for each measurement, using the Firefox data collection categories on the Mozilla wiki.

The data we wish to collect is Category 3 (???첻 activity data??. We intend to
classify URLs into several broad categories, and then send back this information
using randomized response to collect the information in a privacy preserving way.

Pocket will be permanently monitoring this data.

What populations will you measure?

Currently Pocket serves sponsored content in the en-US locale, in all release
channels. For purposes of advertising, only the public release channel is
relevant.

If this data collection is default on, what is the opt-out mechanism for users?

This collection would default to on, but an opt-out mechanism via the firefox
preference pane should be created.

Please provide a general description of how you will analyze this data.

We plan to use this information to improve Pocket's in-browser personalization
framework, with a goal of improving relevance of both organic and sponsored
content.

Where do you intend to share the results of your analysis?

We intent to use this data within the Pocket data teams, and share some of the
results of the analysis as appropriate with advertisers to help them craft their
campaigns.
Additionally, this data could be made available to the greater Mozilla data
science community.

Is there a third-party tool (i.e. not Telemetry) that you are proposing to use for this data collection?

No.

Steps to reproduce:

1. put cursor at the end of the url in url bar
2. press ctrl+backspace a couple of times

in some cases it skips the last word on the first press.

 ",Make title for Add Bookmarks dialog (CTRL+D) more context-sensitive.,"Currently, the Add Bookmark dialog (CTRL+D) says ""Page bookmarked"" in its title regardless of whether the page already *has* been bookmarked through clicking the Star, or whether it is going to be bookmarked if the user presses the ""Done"" button, for example because the dialog has been invoked directly via CTRL+D, without clicking the Star first.
The dialog title should reflect the actual condition. For this, I suggest to use the entity ""bookmarkPageCmd2.label"", which accessibility used for the panel's title prior to fix for bug 415105. It says ""Bookmark this page"", and should be used when CTRL+D is being pressed on a page that has not been bookmarked yet. The dialog already knows about the bookmark not being filed yet: The Undo button is unavailable. So within the same logic, the title should be set correctly to reflect the actual state: The user is *going to* bookmark the page, it hasn't been bookmarked yet."

 ",Exceptions creating outgoing records aren't handled correctly nor reported via telemetry,"Investigating bug 1165811, I changed getTabState in tabs.js to:

* We then fail to count the record as a failure, meaning the error isn't recorded to telemetry. This makes it impossible to determine how many users might be seeing such errors.

* We fail to honor this.allowSkippedRecord, and thus we may end up uploading an inconsistent state for things like bookmarks.

In an ideal world me might want to differentiate the failures here (ie, to differentiate if the error was an unhandled exception or was rejected by the server) and to record details of the exceptions encountered, but just counting them as the same in the short term would be an improvement."

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded to Firefox 57 (with Fedora 27). I also changed the setting in the customization to use the ""compact"" mode.


Actual results:

The icons of the websites are square ones, but the rectangular tabs, which are meant to save space, have a big width. In touch mode this may make sense, but not in the compact mode.

Compared to Australis the width of these tabs did increase, although the ""heavy stylistic elements"" of Australis' curved tabs were removed. So one would have expected these pinned tabs to have a smaller width too, but no??

Expected results:

Let these icons to be square and do not add empty space around these pinned tabs. For the ""usual"" tabs everything looks good/okay, but not for these pinned tabs. They really have a big width.

Also note that pinned tabs are often used to pin services/websites, which should stay open and are known to the user, are frequently used and should only be one click away. That's the whole reason why they only show the icon.
So they do not need all this empty space surrounding them. 

Additionally they can/may be a lot and when you have only 4 tabs open already 1/7th of the width of my 1920x1080px screen are used for these. And 4 ones are not a lot, IMHO."

Steps to reproduce:

Mozilla fixed the problem with the page URL printing on the PDF (bug Fix for Bug 743252).  However, the margin has not been reverted back to what it was before the page URL printing was introduced.  So, the URL was removed, but not the margin adjustment that was made to support the URL.


Actual results:

Users of our application are printing onto labels from the PDF displayed in the Firefox PDF viewer.  Label printing is very precise.   When the URL printing was introduced, users could no longer print to their labels using Firefox, as the alignment was now off - being pushed down by the new header.  We have had to advise our customer to tell their users to use another browser or change their default PDF viewer, which introduces additional support issues.    Bug 743252 fixed part of the problem by suppressing the URL printing, but the top margin was not set back to what it was before Firefix 18.


Expected results:

In order for users to resume printing labels using the Firefox PDF viewer, we need to have the top margin adjusted to what it was before the URL printing in the header was introduced in FF18.   This will return the alignment of the labels back to normal."

like animated pictures.
The effect occured in all open windows at the same time.
The UI was drawn ok at first, but after minimizing and remaximizing the window,
the reload and the stop icon were gone and the homepage icon was shifted to the
left on their place.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Don't know how to exactly do this, I just surfed the web for some time. It did
only occur 2 times until now.

 ",Migration Wizard requires string change for home page selection,"The solution to bug 371309 requires that we change the homepage migration text to be slightly more generic, and to explicitly not include the name of a particular distribution partner.  This requires a single string change with l10n impact.

We require a descriptive string that provides users with enough information to make an informed choice of start page. While the string we've decided on is not ideal, it works in all scenarios. That is, for distribution directly from Mozilla and from any of our partners. We're effectively asserting that ""Firefox Start"" means the home page that Mozilla has determined to be the best possible start page for each of our distribution channels. This should be viewed as a short-term solution.

We will absolutely need to revisit this as part of the branding architecture being proposed for Fx 3.

""Firefox Start, a fast search page with search results by XXX""

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
I did not get my last open tab from the previous session (nor the view source window)

Expected Results:  
I expect the open tabs from the previous session or firefox to advise me to shut all but one window before quitting.

In the actual case I had two windows each with a set of tabs in them and also a view source window. It looks like the last closed window is restored and that this is the view source window. 

This is IMHO the least useful thing to do, either restore all open tabs or close windows in a correct sequence or refuse to quit and get the user to decide which single window should be restored.

 ","session restore may need to handle faststart ""shutdown"" on Windows CE","Our Windows CE builds of Firefox include a faststart component (bug 509249) so that when the last browser window is closed (with [X], not File->Exit), Firefox actually remains in memory with no windows open.

Very often, a problem in a third-party plugin causes Firefox (or Seamonkey, or Mozilla) to crash, losing all open pages and forms.

I have often seen this with the Mplayer plugin - when a movie ends, and the plugin terminates, the browser crashes. Recently, the Adobe Flash 9 plugin for Linux often crashes the browser

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page with particular Flash content
2. Flash content plays
3.
Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
Ideal: software never crashes

Reality: Plugin crashes in its own process or thread. Browser generates popup
saying so. Browser continues to run. Plugin reloads as required on different page

I suspect this is unfixable with the way plugins currently work as dynamically loadable libraries. But the browser is essentially held hostage to software from third-party developers, and it makes Mozilla look bad because from the users's point of view, the browser crashed. It would be nice if somehow it were possible to protect the browser from segfaults and memory violations in plugins."
"New Tab Page
 ",Ensure the bookmark merger flags newer locally moved children for reupload,"Leif's fantastic analysis of the validation data from the new bookmarks engine (https://gist.github.com/irrationalagent/2dd2d50eb8d738b353fb1fb95144d0f5) shows that `parentid` differences are much more frequent for the new engine.

I looked into this in Dogear, and have a theory. :-) When we prefer a local move over a remote move, we give the merged parent a new structure state, but not the merged child. (We only do that for orphans). However, older Desktops and Android use the child's `parentid` to determine the parent, not the parent's `children`. Syncing with another Desktop using the new engine will still work, since it ignores `parentid`. However, syncing with an old Desktop, or with Android, will cause bad things to happen.

We still accidentally did the right thing for items where we took the local value state, since we didn't reset `syncChangeCounter` in that case. However, if we had a newer remote value with a new structure, we'd reset the local change flags and not upload the child...even if it had the right flag before merging."

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Import Wizard under File menu and select any one of the browsers in the
listing.
2.Navigate using the Next button and under ""Select which items to import"" check
off 'Favorites' for I.E., Bookmarks for Netscape or Mozilla.
3.Now navigate back (using back button).

Expected Results:  
If selecting the 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' is mandatory and not doing so
disables the 'Next' button, then on reverting to previous selection screen, the
'Next' button should be enabled.

Refer Snapshots.

Follow up tests
---------------
1. Tried verifying the same behavior with different combinations of the options
provided, however only checking of 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' causes this behavior.
2. Went ahead and imported the checked items and then re-imported the data from
the same browser(s). *Instead of prompting or updating/appending the existing
bookmarks, a new bookmark directory gets created and so we have redundant
bookmark information from the respective browser(s).

Importance of the bug
---------------------
1. It seems that somehow navigation within the Import Wizard is entirely
dependent on what selections the user makes from the choices listed. This is
obvious when the user finishes selection and wants to go ahead and import data.
However if the user wishes to revert or change some previous selections
(profile, browser) then the navigation should not be dependent on the choices
selected. 
This bug indicates 'feature interrrupting feature' and prevents ease of use
(since  one has to cancel and reopen the wizard everytime the big occurs)."

"Extension Compatibility
 ","Attempt to avoid accidental dataloss by removing ""saved passwords"" from clear recent history dialog (not history and doesn't respect timeframe)","Similar premise to bug 472211 but a different potential problem.

The ""Clear Private Data"" system has been changed to a ""Clear Recent History"" system. The dialog is more flexible and allows users to selectively clear only portions of their data and thus might be used more often by people who don't want to wipe everything. There's one problem here: the price of an accident can be high. Most people don't back up their data and if one was to wipe everything when they didn't want to it would be quite bad. One way I think would be useful to attempt to avoid mishaps (aside from adding more confirmation for ""everything"" in bug 472211) would be to remove the saved passwords wiping checkbox from this dialog.

To start, saved usernames and passwords are *not* ""recent history"". The placement here is a bit odd with this new terminology. I and many users can wipe their entire history, cache, cookies, form autocomplete, etc. and not have it be a horrible inconvenience. Wipe my saved passwords and I'll be annoyed. I can visit pages again and remake cookies and autocompletes, but I can't guarantee I'll remember all my logins that easily. I could easily foresee a user clearing everything intentionally then a long while later coming back here for a quick history cleanup and not noticing that the saved passwords box is checked. It's my opinion that this is more dangerous than it needs to be.

This data is more important, not necessarily relevant to the currently labeled dialog function, and there is already a button to wipe them all in the password manager. I think it should be safe to remove it from here and could potentially save some users a good bit of unnecessary grief."

Would it be possible to make this property optional or at least allow a fuzzy match like ""Fennec on *""?

This is how we are defining the test_tabs.js:
EnableEngines([""tabs""]);

var phases = { ""phase1"": ""profile1"" };

// expected tabs state
var tabs1 = [
    { uri: ""www.mozilla.org"",
      profile: ""profile1""
    }
];

// sync and verify tabs
Phase(""phase1"", [
  [Sync],
  [Tabs.verify, tabs1]
]);

But the profile changes for each environment so, if we change the profile to the environment's owner profile, then the test passes.

If changing the property to optional or allowing a fuzzy match is not allowed, is there any workaround we can follow to get the test working?

Steps to reproduce:

today is 2017-1-29
I'am develop my web site with spring mvc restful http.
Yestday, all thing is well.
today I change nothing with my code, but update firefox with 51.0.1,
and then post the ajax json request (Use HttpRequester plugin to mock)
The HttpRequester  was not updated since 2016-04-30


Actual results:

It show me http 415 error.
I debug with my code with spring(4.3.6.RELEASE).
the code I found in the class : org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders,method is   getContentType() at line 744.
-->the mediaType value it get from content type is: ""application/json, application/json""
and then got a http error 415
(Yestoday before firefox udpated, it works,but now it don't)




Expected results:

-->the right content type should be : ""application/json; utf-8""

I change use other browser to mock request is all well.
SpringMVC spilit the content type with "";"", so did other browser.
I think it is a bug in new version of firefox"

In addition, locking these three prefs to true:

pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.current_page
pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.bookmark_page

Is supposed to disable the three homepage buttons in preferences. It is not.

You can use the chrome scratchpad to test this:

var prefs = Services.prefs.getDefaultBranch(null); 
prefs.setBoolPref(""pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.current_page"", true);
prefs.lockPref(""pref.browser.homepage.disable_button.current_page"");

 ",New-tab page has some kinda-slow synchronous flexbox/grid layout,"STR:
0. Install profiler from https://profiler.firefox.com/

Visit about:blank.
Ctrl+Shift+1 to start profiling.
Ctrl+T to open a new tab.
After a few seconds, Ctrl+Shift+2 to stop profiling.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Profile shows a red bar for a period of jank, which includes some flexbox layout.  In particular, there are some script-triggered sync reflows from an IntersectionObserver callback which checks .clientWidth, which I suspect are associated with image lazy-loading.
EXPECTED RESULTS:
I suspect the series of short script/IntersectionObserver-triggered reflows should probably be cheap or free, because layout is probably not changing much.  I'm not sure whether the tiles are styled such that we can theoretically infer that the flex containers involved don't need to reflow, or if there's styling that we would need to add (along with optimizations) to reliably get that result -- but one way or another, we should try to be sure that no serious reflow work needs to happen after the initial layout.
Also/alternatively, perhaps the about:newtab code shouldn't be reading clientWidth in the IntersectionObserver callback, since that forces any of the callback's earlier restyling to be immediately flushed. We're probably not coalescing these multiple IntersectionObserver-callback-invocations' restyling at all right now, due to the fact that they're doing this flush.
Here's a profile I captured of the STR, using current Nightly: https://perfht.ml/2SWyogu (filtered for nsFlexContainerFrame)
The series of 9 reflows (each 2-3ms long) after timestamp 1.64s are the ones that I'm primarily concerned with improving/avoiding.

Test PDF at: http://www.sloplanning.org/gis/mapimagepdf/RuralCDMaps/Rural%20South%20County%20CD.pdf

The PDF downloads VERY slowly (more than 2 minutes on a fast connection) in Firefox, but only seconds in Chrome or IE. When the PDF is rendered, most of the graphic elements within the PDF are missing; comparing the PDF image between FF and Chrome is stark. A good test is to wait through the long download in FF, then press the 'download' button and compare the resulting image displays. The 'downloaded' version has the graphics that are missing from the in-browser display.

At the moment we're stuck telling our clientele to not use FF. :(

In my testing, this is occurring in v27.0.1 of FF on Windows 7; I'm not certain of all the configurations for our clientele where this is also occurring.

I think we should try to make the in-content preferences work without changing the pref to avoid compat. problems and provide an interaction that is more natural for Windows."

 ",Sync telemetry should report more detail about http errors,"Looking at sync telemetry, we see a large number of errors reported as (""othererror"", ""error.engine.reason.something""). In almost all cases, this tends to mean an unexpected http status code (other than 5xx errors which are reported). This makes it difficult to determine what might be going wrong.

For example, on some days, over 5000 unique devices see ""record_upload_fail"" doing the history engine, and this doesn't seem to correlate with stats from the server  - having the status code is likely to give us more insights into what the problem actually is. These errors seems transient, but still aren't ideal.

We should even do this for ""error.engine.reason.batch_interrupted"" - having this reported as (""httperror"", 412) gives us the same information.

Note that doing this would mean we lose information about whether the problem was during upload or download. That seems a reasonable tradeoff for a first cut - we could consider adding the http method used in another bug if we found it would be useful."

Regression from bug 197427

Steps to reproduce

1. From View>>Toolbars>>Customize, add something to the toolbar.
2. Decide that you don't like the addition and click 'Restore Default Set' 
3. Say 'Dude, where's my menu bar?'
4. Close out of Firebird.
5. Run Firebird
6. Note that the menu bar is now aligned right, with the throbber to its left.
7. Go to Customize Toolbar menu and 'Restore Default Set', which restores
everything to normal.

Note: Last step varies... sometimes that causes the menu bar to disappear again,
other times nothing happens, in which case adding something to the task bar and
restoring the default returns everything to normal.

On top of that, when it happens Firefox is no more usable. All tabs content are like in the attached file: a wheel is turning and it is impossible to have any content. Same for new tabs.
I have to restart Firefox.

here's the problem:

you might have a bookmark to

on, export, we do not write out folder item ids, but we do write out place: uris (for saved searches) that include folder items.

what we could do is write out item ids on export.

on import, we won't use them for item ids (we need to create new ids as we create new folders), but we can keep a map of exported ids to new ids, and then fix up place queries.

so, item ids are internally consistent, within a bookmarks.html file (or .json)."

Tried to send page by email, but it no longer appeared in the tool bar nor am I able to place it there.  Add on page says it incompatible though it worked initially with Firefox 12 when the compatibility reporter was installed.   


Actual results:

The send by email icon disappeared from my tool bar and the add on page says app is incompatible with Firefox 12 though it had worked perfectly the day before as long as the compatibility reporter add on was also installed.


Expected results:

I should have been able to send a webpage by email by pressing the send page by email icon."

Actual results:

- Updated to Firefox 58b9: since then, I see some favicons in the bookmark toolbar
- Tried to empty browser cache = no effect
- Tried to close Firefox and delete favicons.sqlite from profile folder = icons are re-created upon restart
- Tried to delete favicons.sqlite and downgrade Firefox to version 58b8 = favicons are no more present and the preference is honored
- Tried to upgrade Firefox again to 58b9 = favicons are shown again


Expected results:

Like in previous version, I expect that the preference browser.chrome.favicons is honored and no favicon is shown in the bookmarks toolbar.

 ",Accessing gBrowser too early breaks other overlays,"I found out that the Adblock Plus toolbar button won't show up on OS X if Firefox Sync is installed (version 1.4 or 1.4.1b2).

> overlay chrome://browser/content/browser.xul chrome://weave/content/firefox/sync.xul application={ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384} appversion<=4.0b2pre

Given that macBrowserOverlay.xul itself is applied to browser.xul this results in having these two Sync overlays being applied to browser.xul twice. I'm not sure why but this appears to be the reason for the breakage - commenting out the macBrowserOverlay lines ""fixes"" the issue."

 ",Temporarily disable failing tests due to process flip: browser_aboutHome_search_composing.js and browser_aboutHome_search_telemetry.js,"Both the tests `browser_aboutHome_search_composing.js` and `browser_aboutHome_search_telemetry.js` rely on the `waitForDocLoadAndStopIt` function.

The current behavior is that the tests add a new progress listener in the `about:home` page and stops the content load whenever there is a network request. The tests then simulate a network load through a mouse click, which attempts to navigate the page and stops the content load. The original `about:home` page will still be displayed to the user because a new load did not occur, allowing subsequent assertions to pass (e.g. checking to ensure that the search bar still has the original value as the one before the navigation).

When we enable the pref to load Activity Stream in a new content process, there will be a process flip whenever we attempt to navigate away from `about:home`. When that happens, calling `waitForDocLoadAndStopIt` will result in an `about:blank` page because the previous session is not persisted during a process flip. After talking to :nika, it seems that this is a known bug and should be fixed by Fission. Theoretically we could just make the tests pass by trying to add some workarounds to prevent navigation, but we don't think it is worth testing a situation that users cannot get into.

I am hoping to ship Bug 1472212 before Fission, but we'll need to acknowledge these two tests and disable them until a fix has been implemented.

 ",Rename some payments variables and files and add a button to debug the remote frame to ease development,"* There are a few files/globals which are similar in name and even though there are in separate directories (content vs. res) and having different contexts it still causes confusion.

* Currently one needs to run 4 lines of code from the docs to debug the remove unprivileged frame. Now that we have a debug frame, we should just have a button to open it instead and save a lot of time.

* When developing using a file: URI (docs added), I often want to keep the debugging panel open so I added a ?debug=1 query parameter to force it to open by default. I currently waste a lot of time focusing the window and hitting the keyboard shortcut after every refresh.

* Rename the `PaymentRequest` global in the unprivileged frame to `paymentRequest` so it doesn't shadow the standard window.PaymentRequest from the Payment Request spec and avoid confusing the two. I considered renaming these files and the global but `paymentRequest.cancel()` just makes sense to me."

Steps to reproduce:

I opened a pdf file from the website is1.mum.edu/vedicreserve. These are older files, ten years old and more, and they use embedded legacy fonts, that are non-unicode fonts for displaying Sanskrit.


Actual results:

Many characters that should show are simply not displayed, nor can they be printed from the browser. Sometimes a tiny trace of the character remains, but not enough for recognition. Essentially, Firefox no longer supports the zero-width characters, the characters which function as diacritical marks, mostly vowels in Sanskrit: That means that the pdf viewer in Firefox does not show the document as it shows in Adobe Reader, or in the Chrome browser, and in versions of Firefox from previous years. 


Expected results:

Firefox should fully support the pdf standard. This is a major lapse, which makes the knowledge on our website inaccessible to people with the Firefox browser. (They can however, download the file successfully, and then view it correctly in Adobe Reader. But the functionality of the Firefox browser as a universal browser is compromised.)"

 ",Allow UITour to check and set Firefox as the default browser,"Windows 10 makes it harder to set the default browser -- instead of just clicking a button within Firefox, the user must perform a sequence of steps in a native Windows dialog that Firefox has no control over.

One idea to help with this is to have a SUMO page that helps guide the user though this UI with a series of screenshots. It would probably be very helpful for that page to have the ability to trigger opening this new Windows dialog.

While the immediate focus of this is dealing with this new UI on Windows 10, maybe we just want to allow this on other platforms too. (To either bring up the usual Firefox prompt, or to just change it immediately.)

Also, I think by implication this means exposing if Firefox is the default browser or not through UITour, so it knows if this should be offered or not.

installed the bug-me-not extension with any problems in the new profile.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1.copied the cert8.db, cookies.txt, defaults.ini, history.dat, key3.db and
prefs.js from my old profile to the new profile
2. Try to start firefox
3. receive error message and CPU goes to 100%

Actual Results:  
Got the nmessage ""Java Plug-in for Netscape Navigator should not be used in
Microsoft IE. Please use Java Plug-in for Microsoft IE instead."" and CPU went to
100%

I suspect that something in the extension install munges up the profiles.

Expected Results:  
Not munged up the profile.



I have seen at least 3 reports of this error on the Internet.  Mostly, I'm
reporting this error so that the ""fix"" of removing the profiles folder will be
known and that there is a problem with Firefox occasionally munging up the
profiles.  I lost everything the first time I got this error.  Now I can get
back my bookmarks but lose all other information (history, cookies, passwords)."

If you switch between History and e.g. Bookmarks the items are only every second time between the dividers. Once the items are added at the end they are not removed anymore extending the menu even more.

Not all the expected engines are listed in Search displays, and can't be restored by ""Restore Default Engines"".
Sometimes hidden engines may also be restored (e.g. bug 1586078).

Bug 1580737 found one cause, which was rebuilding the cache whilst trying to shutdown/restart. It added a prevention to prevent rebuilding the cache.
In bug 1578807 we've attempted a workaround to rebuild the cache if it detects the amount of built-in engines in the cache are different to the expected built-in engines. We also added telemetry, which I am monitoring.
Both of those have landed in Firefox 70.
This bug is for tracking the issues and potential fixes. Currently we're working towards a new configuration backend, which may or may not help with this. However, in the meantime we're going to monitor it.

 ",personalization is off by default in 69,"To ship discovery stream we made a few scope cutting decisions, 1 was to turn off personalization.
At the time, it was our understanding that personalization was mostly being used to trigger rotation of stories.
We built rotation in by default so now that happens with or without personalization.
We also noticed while running our DS tests that there was a uptick of interaction with personalization off, so for the time being we're going to leave it off.
I'm filing this ticket to.

Get this decision in a ticket, and acknowledge the decision that it's off and why.
Start the conversation about what it means to turn it back on, probably run an experiment to validate that turning it on isn't going to regress anything.

 ",Audit `_followQueries` to determine if it's as broken as we think it is,"We use `_followQueries` to find the concrete records for `place:` queries. A few things about that function stand out:

* It relies on `recordMap` actually matching what's in Places. In theory, that's OK; we assume there's no cycle if the query record doesn't exist. (It's hard to determine this without a real tree, since we don't sync enough information to map numeric folder IDs in `place:` URLs to their GUIDs. The common exceptions are https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/152c0296f8a10f81185ee88dfb4114ec3882b4c6/toolkit/components/places/nsNavHistoryQuery.cpp#160-165).

* We accidentally called `PlacesUtils.getFolderContents` with the wrong argument (bug 1119282), which might also explain the surprisingly high incidence of `clientCycles` problems in our validation data.

* We loop over the query's siblings to find `queryNode`, but it's not clear to me how these two lines are different, and if the loop can be removed: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/152c0296f8a10f81185ee88dfb4114ec3882b4c6/services/sync/modules/bookmark_validator.js#239,259

 ",A bunch of tests don't like waiting for focus/activate events once we remove the initial about:blank load,"I tested the fix in bug 1500818 against the status quo, and I tested locally whether it fixed orange I saw in browser_contextmenu_linkopen.js with the initial about:blank doc removed.

Unfortunately, before landing I neglected to check what the result of the combination of that patch and disabling the initial about:blank doc was on try, against all the other tests - I just assumed it'd be beneficial everywhere. Here's an actual trypush:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=2a1416e0ea05d318211db0e3ffd0d3951d0eae4e&selectedJob=207070966

Now, the good news is most of the failures are very straightforward. Tests wait for the new window, and then wait for the initial browser to load - but they now time out on Linux, because the focus/activate events arrive after the initial browser's loaded, so then they wait forever for the document in question to load because it already did.

I'm a bit on the fence about whether to fix all these tests, or back out bug 1500818 and then fix just browser_contextmenu_linkopen.js to explicitly wait for focus/activate stuff itself. On the one hand, fixing these things will, I believe, make the tests more resilient, and the focus/activate stuff is a 'gotcha' that we should try to address structurally. On the other, we're replacing one hard-to-figure-out cause of issues (spurious focus/activate events after window opening/closing interfering with popups) with another (focus/activate events making it harder to 'catch' other events early in the lifetime of the new window).

I've got a local set of patches for these failures so I'll put that up and then you can decide, D筌≫뫁, or we can discuss in more detail if you've got other ideas about how to address this."

From a crash report:  http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/27165375-a90f-11dc-99a5-001a4bd43e5c

Looking at the code:

 339    // Stop all searches in case they are async.
 340    StopSearch();
 341                   
 342    PRBool isOpen;
 343    mInput->GetPopupOpen(&isOpen);

From the stack:

1	NS_InvokeByIndex_P	mozilla/xpcom/reflect/xptcall/src/md/win32/xptcinvoke.cpp:101

This sounds familiar, right?  (See bug #395344)

After we call StopSearch(), we need to check mInput

Something like:

   // Stop all searches in case they are async.
   StopSearch();
 
+  if (!mInput) {
+    // StopSearch() can call PostSearchCleanup() which might result
+    // in a blur event, which could null out mInput, so we need to check it
+    // again.  See bug #395344 for more details

 ",Touch events sometime don't register on tab bar (Windows 10),"When using Firefox on a touch screen device, the tab strip currently responds very unpredictable. Sometimes touches on a background tab are registered, sometimes they aren't.
The curious thing is that Windows' touch indicator shows that the tap has hit the tab just fine, but it still won't trigger.
This is particularly annoying on smaller touch targets like pinned tabs or the new tab button.

See the video in the attachment for a demonstration.

FWIW, switching the UI density to touch doesn't change this behavior.

Since we are advertising touch-friendlyness in Photon, I suggest that it should be in scope for that."

- XPI

When I say ""standard <platform> document look"" I mean that the document
component of icon should look as if it had shipped with the OS - the same style

being a foreign intruder.

 ",Autocomplete is slow the first time,"The new autocomplete implementation in bug 320181 can be slow the first time you use it. This is because the sqlite (the basis for the new history system) pages data in lazily. The old Mork system brought all history into memory at startup. The new system results in faster startup times when history is large, but the speedup isn't free. The data still needs to be loaded.

On fast local disks the delay isn't a big deal. I have a networked home directory on Linux and it can be quite slow. The first time I press a new letter in the URL bar, it freezes until the needed data can be brought over the network. This takes almost no time up to several seconds depending on how many matches there are and the mood of the network.

Perhaps we can set a timer on startup to bring some data into the cache after the window is displayed. This will freeze the browser during that time, however.  We may have to play with different strategies to see where the pause is the least noticable."

I just untarred the firefox 2 alpha 1, and after starting it up with my old profile (from 1.5), it hangs for a while, before giving a ""script is running slow"" message.

The script triggering this is apparently trying to find the searchengines availaible in my profile, but finding none.

Trying the searchbox in the top gives me the same results, (since there are no search engines installed)

Shouldn't we either show the user a ""install your favorite search engine"" option, or remove the search box from the top all together if there are no engines installed? (this will allow sys-admins to just clean out the search-engine folder without crashing the foxes on their clients pc's.

Or we could just search on the local page, if there are no search engines installed. like with crtl-F

# Data Review Form

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set in a public, complete, and accurate way?

This will be documented in the [Events.yaml file[(https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/data/event-ping.html). Note this is data specific to an experiment at this moment in time.

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off? (Note, for data collection not needed for security purposes, Mozilla provides such a control mechanism) Provide details as to the control mechanism available.

Users can disable this by opt-ing out of Telemetry in the Firefox preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

This is not permanent

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2: Interaction Data

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

default-off, experiment only

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers (whether anonymous or otherwise; e.g., username, random IDs, etc. See the appendix for more details)?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data? (Yes/No) (If yes, set a todo reminder or file a bug if appropriate)**

No.

    Does the data collection use a third-party collection tool?

No.

Right now Firefox seems to be shipping with a handful of strangely sized application icons (at least strange for the use on a Linux desktop). There are two things that should be done:

## Provide separate icons in PNG format for the commonly used sizes 16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32 and 48x48. All with nice alpha and AA. Not just scaled down versions but tweaked versions to better fir the smaller sizes. If possible, also provide a scalable version of the logo in SVG format. This would fix the look of the Application launcher in the menu.

## Don't use a fixed size icon for the window icon. The current icon (48x48?) looks very blurry in the window list (scaled down to 16x16) but looks pixelized in window previews, scale and the task switcher. GTK apps have a mechanism to pick up the right size of the icon from share/icons/hicolor/apps/$SIZE/$APPNAME.png

 ",[Nudges] Engaging with the urlbar should cause tips not to be shown anymore in any session,"QA pointed this out tonight, and I forgot that Verdi and I had talked about it last month. The spec says that when a tip is showing and the user clicks in the urlbar, it should be the same as if they had clicked the ""okay got it"" button: we shouldn't show tips anymore. I asked Verdi about that because we don't currently have a urlbar API that would let us handle that, and the intention is to acknowledge that the user has ""seen"" the tip and therefore we shouldn't bother them with it anymore.
We can listen for something not quite the same but that I think still follows the intention: the tip is showing and we receive an ""engagement"" event. i.e., the tip was visible, and then the user engaged with the urlbar. That might be even better than listening for a click because with engagement we know they actually engaged. I haven't talked to Verdi about specifically using engagement, though.

PRELIMINARY NOTE:

I notice that there's no specific filters in place in the code ensuring that nothing other than ""about:welcome"", ""about:home"", and ""about:newtab"" are reported. Since these are URLs, I would feel more confident if there was a filter ensuring only these values (and maybe a value of ""other"" as a catch-all) were reported.

(( Also, might these urls might have path, query, and fragment information in them? ))

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is documented in its [in-tree docs](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/components/newtab/docs/v2-system-addon/data_events.md).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences or Activity Stream's preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

Yes, Nan Jiang is responsible.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

No. This collection is permanent.

"Tabbed Browser
 ","Sync should enter the ""please reconnect"" state if it appears Sync is configured but FxA isn't.","On my ""loungeroom"" PC I witnessed the following:

* Sync was previously configured and working fine.
* Some time later I happened to notice Sync was no longer configured.
* I looked in the profile dir, and for reasons that will probably remain unknown, found a login.json with 220 space characters and nothing else.
* Opening the log, I see that FxA failed to init with a json parse error.

End result for the user was that Sync just magically and silently disconnected itself.

I've no idea how long the browser was in that state for - it was connected to my wife's sync account and she didn't know either - she just noticed sync didn't seem to be doing much.

It would have been helpful if Firefox detected this and entered the ""please reconnect"" state, as though the user's password changed - this would have been more obvious on the hamburger menu.

A complication here will be bug 1380215 - there, we describe a case where we are in this same state (sync thinks it is configured, FxA doesn't) but do not want ""please reconnect"". Personally, I think it's better for Sync to be in a ""please reconnect"" state when it shouldn't than not in a ""please reconnect"" state when it should. IOW, I believe we should fix this bug, causing bug 1380215 to be slightly worse until it is fixed.

Alex, I guess the priority of this is really a product question - WDYT about the relative importance of this bug, and the above paragraph re bug 1380215?"

 ",make sure that CalculateFrecencyInternal() does not return 0 for places with at least one visit of bonus-able type,"make sure that CalculateFrecencyInternal() does not return 0 for places with at least one non-embed visit.

as mentioned in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394038#c62, if a place has frecency of 0, we do not show it in the url bar autocomplete results.

additionally, because it has a frecency of zero, on idle, we will not attempt to recalculate frecency (because 0 is a low as you go, and -1 means ""visible in ac results, but please recalculate me on idle"".)

we need to make sure that if a place has any non embed, non download, non undefined visits that it gets a non-zero frecency.

here's one way this currently happen:

CalculateFrecencyInternal() uses the browser.frecency.numVisits (currently 10) most recent visits.  if those are all visits with browser.frecency.*VisitBonus of zero (like embed or download), our frecency will be zero. but what if the 11th visits was a link, bookmark, or typed?

we could fix this problem by excluding visits NOT IN (0,4,7) from our query to find the last 10 visits, but that makes the assumption that the bonus for embed and download are zero.

here's where we'd fix the query:

  // mDBVisitsForFrecency
  // NOTE: we are not limiting to visits with ""visit_type NOT IN (0,4)""
  // because if we do that, mDBVisitsForFrecency would return no visits
  // for places with only embed (or undefined) visits.  That would
  // cause use to estimate a frecency based on what information we do have,
  // see CalculateFrecencyInternal().  that would result in a 
  // non-zero frecency for a place with only
  // embedded visits, instead of a frececny of 0.
  rv = mDBConn->CreateStatement(NS_LITERAL_CSTRING(
    ""SELECT visit_date, visit_type FROM moz_historyvisits "" 
    ""WHERE place_id = ?1 ORDER BY visit_date DESC LIMIT "") +
     nsPrintfCString(""%d"", mNumVisitsForFrecency),
    getter_AddRefs(mDBVisitsForFrecency));
  NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);

I guess we could avoid hard coding and programtically build up the NOT IN(...) based on the pref values.

additionally, this could happen if the weights chosen for any of the buckets was zero:

+// weights for buckets for frecency calculations
+pref(""browser.frecency.firstBucketWeight"", 100);
+pref(""browser.frecency.secondBucketWeight"", 70);
+pref(""browser.frecency.thirdBucketWeight"", 50);
+pref(""browser.frecency.fourthBucketWeight"", 30);
+pref(""browser.frecency.defaultBucketWeight"", 10);

note to dietrich:  put a warning about how these weights need to be > 0.

+
+// bonus (in percent) for visit transition types for frecency calculations
+pref(""browser.frecency.embedVisitBonus"", 0);
+pref(""browser.frecency.linkVisitBonus"", 120);
+pref(""browser.frecency.typedVisitBonus"", 200);
+pref(""browser.frecency.bookmarkVisitBonus"", 140);
+pref(""browser.frecency.downloadVisitBonus"", 0);
+pref(""browser.frecency.permRedirectVisitBonus"", 0);
+pref(""browser.frecency.tempRedirectVisitBonus"", 0);
+pref(""browser.frecency.defaultVisitBonus"", 0);

note to dietrich:  

are those values for permRedirectVisitBonus and tempRedirectVisitBonus correct?  should they, like embed and download, be worth nothing?"

Steps to reproduce:

Create a malicious dll named 'dwmapi.dll'position it in the program files (x86) Mozilla firefox firectory


Actual results:

the application accepts and executes the DLL (giving me a meterpreter session with metasploit, for example) 


Expected results:

the application should have a manifest file defining all DLL's needed to load, rather than searching current folder, it actually searches and fails to find not only 'dwmapi.dll' but others, I don't know if all will execute or what the impact is on firefox loading but I have validated dwmapi.dll with metasploit - granted, you need elevated rights to position it in the folder, this might not be the case for portable apps (this effects the tor browser bundle too, (that's where I saw it first)"

HI!!

THE BROWSER CRASHES IN A CONSTANT WAY.
SOME OF THE REASONS ARE:     JS3250.DLL, CONFLICT WITH DR.WATSON32, 
CONFLICT WITH NTDLL, .

SO, IN A MAIN WAY; THE JS3250.DLL ERRORS HAVE BECOME PRESENT IN **ALL** VERSIONS,EITHER STABLE OR BETAS SINCE QUITE A WHILE NOW. 

SO INSTEAD OF RELEASING NEW BETAS WITH EXTRA FEATURES, YOU HAVE TO FOCUS IN FIXING THOSE ERRORS OF JS3250, AND QUITE FLANKLY AND DONT KNOW HOW YOU HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE FILE IN ALL THIS TIME.

YOU SHOULD CHECK LINE BY LINE OF THE PROGRAMMING CODE, TO FIND THE PROB., AND TO CHECK IF AN EXTERNAL OPERATION OF JS3250.DLL (ANOTHER FILE OF THE BROWSER), OR A SUB-RUTINE STARTED BY JS3250 ITS AFFECTING IT.
AND THE RESTORE SESSION, ITS NOT A WELL-BEING OPTION OF ALL THE PROBS.

WELL, HOPING THAT THIS HELPS YOU, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO IT CAUSE INDEED FIREFOX ITS THE BEST THERE IS, BUT MUST FIX THOSE ***VITAL ERRORS***.

ALSO YOU SHOULD KEEP THE BOOKMARKS FORMAT OF THE STABLE ONES, THE ONES OF THE BETAS ARE NOT QUITE GOOD.


Reproducible: Sometimes

THE ERRORS ARE UNAFFECTED BY ANY BROWSER OR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION, THEY HAPPEN ANY TIME.

"Installer
 ",Add a way to change the backspace key behavior in the content area,"I've just done some testing in various Linux graphical apps that show uneditable
things (what we do in browser) and which page down on space (like we do; this
excludes the obvious Windows port-over that is Adobe acrobat).  Here are the
results:

xdvi -- backspace does page up
Netscape 4 -- backspace does page up
emacs (patch viewer mode) -- backspace does page up
Konqueror -- backspace does nothing
Opera -- backspace does history back
Firefox -- backspace does history back
SeaMonkey -- backspace does nothing
gv -- backspace does page up
ggv -- backspace does page up

So it look to me like platform convention is to do page up on backspace
(including in nice GNOME apps like ggv).   The exceptions are all web browsers,
which are mostly copying IE.  If I've missed apps I should have tested, please
let me know.

I think we should follow platform convention here and make backspace do pageup.

Note that this is asking for the bug 208035 patch to be reversed.

Also note that the equivalent SeaMonkey bug (bug 36922) was wontfixed over a
good bit of protest.  I think the reasoning listed in that bug is quite valid."

Although it currently works on the Bookmarks Toolbar and in Places Organizer, using a drag n drop key-modifier on a bookmarks *FOLDER* in the Bookmarks Menu does not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks menu and navigate to a bookmarks folder (""Places"" will do, or create a new one)
2. Try to move or copy the folder using either SHIFT or CTRL keys as a modifier (ie: hold down SHIFT or CTRL then left-click-and-hold then drag.
Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. Can't move or copy a folder. The pointer does not change to its expected modified state of '+'(copy) or rectangle(move).


Obviously, no drop indicator is shown - which is another bug, actually Bug 389290, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=389290 but possibly tied in.

Also be aware that the Ctrl key modifier is partially-broken anyhow: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=400661

And that bookmarks menu sub-menus(folders) no longer expand when the mouse is held over the -> arrow during drag n drop. I'm about to file this Bug too...."

Steps to reproduce:

It seems that there's an issue with URL parsing in Mozila Firefox which can either lead to Freezing Firefox (user will not able to perform anything) or Phishing attack. When visiting URL (pasting URL) ""https://domain.com%0A&@fakesite.com"" in address bar, it seems that user is making https request for ""domain.com"" but due to parsing issue, Mozila Firefox will either freeze and will not allow user to do anything (perform any operations) or Mozila Firefox will make request to fakesite.com and user will be redirected to this site ""fakesite.com"".

Firefox version: 59.0.2 (64 bit)
OS: Windows 7 Enterprise SP1 (64 bit)


Actual results:

Case 1. First time, when I visited URL ""https://domain.com%0A&@fakesite.com"", my Mozia Firefox was freeze and I was not able to perform any activity. I have to kill Firefox process from Task Manager.
Case 2. Second time, when I visited URL ""https://domain.com%0A&@fakesite.com"", I was redirected to ""fakesite.com"" instead of redirecting to ""domain.com"". This can be using in Phishing attack which can lure user by making them believe they are requesting for domain after http|https (domain.com in above example) but actually browser will make request to domain after @ (i.e. fakesite.com in above example).


Expected results:

Ideally, I should have redirected to requested URL ""https://domain.com%0A&@fakesite.com"" instead of freezing firefox or redirecting to ""fakesite.com"""

On the advice of someone on Launchpad (The Ubuntu bug reporting site), I am cross posting this bug here.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5/+bug/477513

FireFox crashes routinely. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Surf to various sites. That's all that's needed.

Actual Results:  
FireFox will crash.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should not crash.

Seems to be related to changing pages. If I stay on a site and don't navigate to too many pages, FireFox may stay alive for longer (though not guarunteed).

Surfing to many pages in a shorter period of time increases the likelihood of crashing sooner.

I can reliably crash FireFox in under a minute by randomly surfing without stopping to look too long at the content.

Please see the bug report on launchpad for crash output and further details."

 ",htm files won't open after uninstalling firefox,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

I decided to try Firefox and still want to use it.

However, I noticed that unlike before, when I created an htm page using MS 
Word2000, the text IN text boxes was always ""justified"", not ""aligned left"". So 
I uninstalled Firefox to see if that would make any difference.

I uninstalled Firefox as per your instructions and usual practice 
using ""Add/Remove Programs"" in the Control Panel.

Now, when I click on any htm file stored on my floppy or harddrive, it won't 
open even though I DO have Internet Explorer 6.0 installed on my computer and 
updated.

Also, all of the icons beside the htm files are FIREFOX ICONS, not Internet 
Explorer icons, despite the fact that I've temporarily uninstalled Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to harddrive or floppy and double click on any .htm file.
2. 
3.

Actual Results:  
A box pops up:

""Windows cannot find FIREFOX.EXE.

This program is needed for opening files of this type"".

Location of FIREFOX.EXE.

C:/

Expected Results:  
Open the document in Internet Explorer now that I've uninstalled Firefox!

I tried restarting my computer; installing and uninstalling Firefox. Now it 
seems that my computer will ONLY open htm files if I have Firefox on it... and 
it is ""broken"" for that purpose if I choose to use Internet Explorer.

I hope this is not by design.

Please advise soonest.

The whole purpose of my computer is to create htm documents and turn them into 
web pages. If I am now unable to do this and later view them from my harddrive 
or floppy without using Firefox, I will be choked.

Your attention to this is appreciated.

Thanks.

Chris

P.S. The ideal solution for me would be to have Firefox installed, and use it 
for my web surfing, but to have IE open files of this type so I can check them 
since most people use IE currently. However, not being able to open files of 
this type at all unless I have Firefox installed is not satisfactory."

If there are toolbar item(s) to the right of the Bookmarks Toolbar Items, and
the browser window is too narrow, the toolbar items(s) are shoved past the
righthand browser window border.  If the chevron appears, it only shows the
hidden bookmarks toolbar items.  The extra 'normal' toolbar items are not shown.

The bookmarks toolbar overflow should treat other toolbar items that are to the
right of the BT and are against the browser border as if the toolbar items were
the browser border and use the chevron rather than shoving the toolbar items off
view. (good luck parsing that sentence...)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Shrink browser window horizontally (this makes it easier to see the problem
if you have few BT items)
2. Customize Toolbars...
3. Place a toolbar item to the right of the 'BT Items' (eg the Throbber).
4. Put enough items to the left of the BT Items to overflow the BT.
5. Exit customize toolbars
6. Refresh screen to show the chevron (bug 173493)

Actual Results:

Expected Results:

bounded by the righthand browser border; the BT should make the chevron appear

"Firefox Accounts
 ",WebPages can bypass FPN's webrtc checks,"FPN tries to disable WebRTC by setting a bunch of properties to undefined in a content script. But page JavaScript runs before content scripts, so a page can grab WebRTC APIs before the content script gets to it just by doing:
navigator._mediaDevices = navigator.mediaDevices;
navigator._mediaDevices.__proto__._getUserMedia = navigator._mediaDevices.__proto__.getUserMedia;

I don't know how serious this is: I warned about this in August and was told that the WebRTC would be supported in 69/70 (and thus I assumed this code would be gone). But its still there as of version 0.11 so I'm filing this so it doesn't get lost.
The current checks will stop legitimate sites accidentally leak via webrtc, but a webpage which deliberately want to bypass FPN could use this (assuming that is the point of the WebRTC check in the first place).

A few weeks back, I downloaded Firefox 3.x (I'm sorry I don't exactly remember which version) on a Intel CoreDuo iMac. While trying to do some transactions on my bank website www.bancanet.com, which belongs to Banamex, one of the biggest banks in Mexico, it crashed repeatedly, so I went back to Firefox 2. Now I tried again with Firefox 3.0.5 on a PC, and the browser still crashes while navigating that site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a bancanet.com account.
2.At first, it works fine, but when trying to actually make a transaction, the browser crashes. 
3.When starting Firefox again, it restored the site, but only one of the frames. When trying to navigate the site, it crashed again.
Actual Results:  
I understand it won't be easy to check this out, other than accesing the site using an account. Obviously I can't share my bank account access information. Perhaps you could try to contact the bank's site development team to report on these crashes.

Expected Results:  
I don't mind keep using Firefox 2. My only concern is if something should happen and could't be able to keep using Firefox on a Mac, because Firefox is the only browser with which I can access my bank account in a Mac. On PC, the site works fine with Firefox 2 and Internet Explorer. However, I prefer Firefox.

I am using Firefox 1.0 (i installed the newest version yesterday off the site,
and that didnt fix it)

I downloaded the Java plugin for firefox, i also have the java runtimes for MSIE
installed. I tried the java control panel and nothing. I tried to remove the
java plugin for firefox manually, but I can't find where it is.

Steps to reproduce:

Hi,

There is a problem with HTML5 notification permission request in Firefox 55.0b12. It's not shown (or blinking) when HTML page which asks for notification permission is run inside 'popup' window opened from Firefox add-on.

I've created a simple Firefox add-on which creates popup window and navigates to http://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html web page. This page checks HTML5 notification site capability. Notification permission request show should appear once you press 'Authorize' button.

Note:

1. The problem is not reproduced in Firefox 54
2. The same problem exists in Firefox Nightly version
3. To reproduce the problem please make sure that you've cleared Site Preferences.
4. Password save dialog is not shown as well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Unzip firefox_notifications.zip (attached) to some folder
2. Go to Beta Firefox and navigate to about:debugging
3. Click on ""Load Temporary Add-On"" button and select any file from the folder
4. Press on cogwheel button located in Firefox toolbar.
5. Press 'Authorize' button.



Actual results:

HTML5 Notification permission request is shown

There is a bit there about en-GB in one of the errors. I think that's unrelated, but never know. We were changing some stuff in the profile when we started to debug, and one of those was to play around with the region/locale. That might be why it's reporting en-GB there.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Firefox via start up menu OR icon on desktop
2. type in *any* URL (doesn't matter which one - does this regardless of what site you are visiting...have had it happen on AOL, Yahoo, Wikipedia, MySpace...)
3. at random times, Firefox will close stating it has 'encountered' an error
4. close down Firefox, then restart again via start up menu or icon on desktop
5. it will ask if you wish to restore old session or start new session - I choose start new just in case something happened during old one to cause shutdown
6. start process all over again with random shutting down of program
Actual Results:  
See steps under ""reproducibility"" - that pretty much sums it up.  No special set-up steps or anything to make it happen.  Also no rhyme nor reason to it happening, and no warning.

I'm not sure if the screenshot code is new or existing, but as a consequence, web pages can the content process to attempt a load of a local file. Luckily the sandbox stops the load, but it seems bad that the load  is even attempted.

Create a page with a tag like:

The code in ContentMetaHandler[1]  doesnt seem to do any validation of the data pulled out of the content page. That sounds dangerous to me, but Im not sure if the expectation is that sanitzation/validation happens later.

Allowing web pages to coerce chrome privileged requests (I assume this is chrome privileged since the file load occurs) is dangerous. I don't _think_ there is any way to exploit this directly since a) the content doesnt come back to the web and b) sandboxing adds a layer of defense. But not fixing this seems like it would be asking for future trouble if this bug could be chained with something else."

See this video recording of Firefox startup captured on the quantum reference hardware: https://bug1372518.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8877069

At first paint there's no space reserved in the toolbar for the screenshot icon.
Then some empty area appears.
Then this area is expended and the screenshot icon appears in it.
Then the screenshot icon disappears.
Then it's replaced by an icon with a purple star.

Ideally the correct icon should already be displayed at first paint. If that turns out to be impossible, we should at least ensure the right amount of space is reserved at first paint, so that we don't see the location bar and searchbar shifting to the left twice (it actually shifts a third time on this video, but that's either due to Pocket or to the profiler add-on).

If I could file this on bugzilla, it would block the photon-startup bug.

My problem (bug?) is a large-ish text url (all tables stuff) that totally
crapsout FF (FireFox). The page is about 6 MB of text and links
and comsumes more than 222 MB of memory.  Due to my memory constraints
FF gets totally IO bound thrashing in swap. I have captured a few snap-
shots of top loading this page locally with some comments interspersed.
I can open and use fine in Lynx and Links.

I think this is the show stopper showing what many others are seeing
opening many tabs etc. I hope this simple example will help with a
fix.

Steps to reproduce:

0) Create a new profile in current nightly (2018-02-04).
1) Add the following search engine:

		<Param name=""query"" value=""{searchTerms}"" />
	</Url>
	<SearchForm>https://www.startpage.com/</SearchForm>
</SearchPlugin>

2) Set ""about:newtab"" as Home Page in Preferences -> General
3) Restart
4) Start Network Monitor (Ctrl+Shift+E) to observe network requests.
5) Enter any search term in the awesome bar and search with the added ""StartPage"" search engine.
6) Do another search in the same way.


Actual results:

The first request is (incorrectly) sent as GET to https://www.startpage.com/do/search
This request gets redirected to https://www.startpage.com/ because it has no search parameters set.

The second request is correctly sent as POST with the ""query"" parameter set to the search terms. This results in a proper web search.



Expected results:

The first request should have been a POST request with the proper parameters set."

 ",Rename locales to locales-src to avoid accidentally exporting l10n-exposed strings,"In bug 1496246, we accidentally did a normal export / buildmc that copies over our browser/locales/??newtab.properties file that then gets exposed to localization. In the past, I've just manually excluded the string file (while keeping the browser/components/newtab/{,prerendered/}locales/??changes), but I failed to catch it in the review process.

The string changes don't need to be exported because l10n-central already has a unified view of strings across central, beta, etc., so just having the string in mozilla-central is sufficient.

However, the string changes also lead to undesired l10n signoffs as noted in bug 1496246 comment 20."

 ","clear search history option can be misleading, because it also doesn't clear history","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Debian/1.7.8-1
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0.6-ubuntu13

The `clear search history' option (on the context menu in the search box) has
two problems:

1. If invoked, it does not immediately save the updated profile, so a subsequent
crash can undo the clear.

2. When invoked, the normal browser history still contains the URLs for the
search results pages.  This completely defeats the effect unless the user knows
to clear the browser history.

Both of these problems mean that the feature is a privacy risk, as it can lead
to a false sense of security.  The first is easy to fix.  The second is harder:
the only correct approach would be to clear all relevant entries from the
browser history or perhaps to ask the user whether to clear the browser history too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce 1:
1. Start firefox
2. Check that some saved search info is present (eg by watching for completion
in the search box)
3. Select `clear search history' from the search box context menu
4. Send firefox a SIGKILL
5. Restart firefox
6. Observe that the search history is still present

For problem 2:
1. Start firefox
2. Check that some saved search info is present (eg by watching for completion
in the search box)
3. Select `clear search history'
4. Observe that the browser history still records the search (eg by starting
typing http://www.google.co.uk/.... in the location bar and watching the
completions)



I will disable the `clear search history' option for Ubuntu Breezy (our next
stable release).

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

Pages such as the one at http://www.worldtoilet.org/hp/wto_hp.htm use javascript
(an applet?) to control a banner or other feature meant to be displayed at the
top of a page. The problem is that Firefox displays the banner in the same
window-relative position as the page is scrolled. The banner should remain at
the top of the page and should not advance with the page as the page is scrolled
in its window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page (e.g., http://www.worldtoilet.org/hp/wto_hp.htm)
2. Check animated banner at top of page. Set window size so that the entire page
is NOT displayed without scrolling
3. Scroll down in window

Actual Results:  
Animated banner meant for the top of the page overwrites text and graphics on
the page as it's scrolled in its window

Expected Results:  
The animated banner should render only at the top of the page in its original
position. It should not appear when the window scrolls below the original
position of the banner."

 ",prevent focus stealing between windows/tabs,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

Firefox (and maybe the Mozilla browser itself, I don't have it installed) allows
one page to steal the keyboard focus from another page. This is particularly
annoying when entering some text, for example a password, in a site. In the
middle of your typing, the keyboard focus goes to another window - maybe even a
background tab - and the password you typed goes to that site's textbox!
This is, when I think about it, a major security issue. It can be used to steal
passwords.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. When in a page with a textbox, open another page in a tab.
2. Manually set the focus on the first page textbox, start typing.
3. When the second page has loaded, if it has some kind of onload=""focus"" event,
it will steal your text input.



Expected Results:  
Somehow notify me that the tab wants to steal focus, but don't pass it. Windows
XP has a ""tweak-ui"" applet that can be used to make windows flash in the taskbar
when they try to steal focus. This idea can be used here."

fix the bug), because it's not consistent with other Mac browsers (not a good
reason; nothing wrong with being better than other browsers), and/or because on

I think I may inadvertantly found a bug that could be used for a ""DoS exploit""
that might even be able to become a buffer overflow in that:

If you load chrome://browser/content in a new window or tab (should be easy to
do  in javascript, for example) and then close that window or tab (also should
be easy to do), FireFox crashes completely at a consistent memory address. So
far, I have reproduced this behavior in FireFox 1.0 on both Windows 2000 and XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox.
2. Vist a website.
3. Open a new tab or a second window.
4. Enter ""chrome://browser/content"" in the address bar, it will load
""chrome://browser/content/browser.xul"" in that tab or window.
5. Close that tab or window, FireFox will crash at a consistant memory address.

Actual Results:  
FireFox always crashes at a consistant memory address.

Expected Results:  
Either:

1. Block such requests from the user.
2. Ignore such requests when not required.
3. Close only one instance of itself and not crash.

Confirmed on Windows 2000 (SP0 and SP4) and Windows XP, all running FireFox 1.0."

 ",Batch Sync pings,"Georg, Alessio and I decided that even though there's not yet any smoke, there's enough heat that we should ensure things don't catch fire in the future - so we should batch the sync ping submissions. We've come up with a plan that we think will help the backend significantly while still giving us the metrics we want and without too much client-side effort.

Basic strategy is that we buffer the pings and send them a minimum of once per day (or maybe twice per day?)

* Sync ""payloads"" are all buffered in memory rather than immediately submitted.

* We impose an upper limit on the number of such records we keep in memory (and thus the number we actually submit.) Sync typically runs once every 10 minutes, which corresponds to 144 Syncs per day. However, operations performed by the browser may cause it to Sync more often. A guideline is that the max ping size is around 1MB including metadata, so I propose we limit this to 500 syncs. After this limit we count the syncs we discarded and include that count in the payload, as this still allows us to detect clients doing an insane number of syncs.

(There's an open question on the above re detecting when our payload still exceeds the maximum size imposed by telemetry even with this 500 limit in place. I think we would want to know if that happened, but we can consider doing that in a different bug, as it probably requires assistance from the telemetry modules - IIUC, they just throw oversized pings on the floor)

* On startup, schedule a timer that fires every 24 hours (12 hours?) and an observer for quit-application. Actually, we probably want just an ""interval"" that we re-create each time it fires - we want to make sure that, say, when a device is asleep for a few days before waking up, we (a) correctly submit the ping immediately but (b) don't see the timer fire immediately multiple times to account for every 24/12 hours the device was asleep for. I *think* using an interval will do the right thing here, which we should check. A fallback would be listening for a ""wake_notification"" observer.

* On either that timer or observer firing, put the payload together and send it to telemetry. It will manage the persisting of the payload even when called during shutdown. Thus, Sync never needs to actually persist anything.

* We will lose pings due to a crash, which probably doesn't matter. We *might* later want to know we lost such pings (eg, so we can exclude those clients from analysis), but we can add stuff to the schema later if necessary via a different bug.

* The ping format changes in such a way that it is consistent regardless of how many submissions we make and how many pings are in it. Something like:

Existing: {""type"": ""sync"", ..., ""payload"": { ""when"": 1470908281556, ... } }

Changes to:
    {
      type: ""sync"", ...
      payload: {
        syncs: [array of existing payload objects],
        numDiscarded: integer - the number of Sync records we discarded due to rate limiting
        why: string, either ""scheduled"" or ""shutdown"",
    }

* We don't bother bumping the schema version. We uplift this patch to Aurora. Analysis done against Aurora will need to take these 2 different formats into account, but that's doable. There will only be a single format once it hits beta/release, which is what we really care about anyway."

Build Identifier: 

On my machine at work -- which runs Linux Fedora Core 3 -- I attempted to
upgrade Firefox from 1.03 to 1.04.  By default, the installer was installing it
in the location it was unpacked: /tmp/firefox-installer.  This was singularly
useless (I suspect that a cron job automatically cleans up /tmp), so I decided
to install it in another location.  The existing firefox was in /usr/bin, so I
entered that as the install location.  I was then expecting it to ask me if I
wanted to over-write the existing firefox binary, so I was ready to click ""yes"",
which I did -- belatedly realizing it was saying something about overwriting the
entire directory.  I attempted to use this ""wizard"" to step backwards and make 
re-do this, but it was already too late.  The entire contents of /usr/bin had
been erased, and I spent half a day re-building the machine.  

(Please don't try and tell me this is a feature.  Please don't tell me you think
it's a great idea to have a ""Is it okay to destroy your machine?"" dialog box.)







Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download installer
2. Choose an existing directory to install it to
3. Watch anything that was in that directory disappear

Actual Results:  
Erased /usr/bin, descended into RPM hell.

Expected Results:  
The software should have either just installed a firefox binary in that location
and not worried about anything else there, or it should have looked at what was
there, and refused to install because it clearly wasn't a firefox-only location."

3. Clicked on Tools -> Page Info -> Security tab, but nothing is displayed (as indicated in the attached screenshot). Clicking on any of the buttons (View Certificate, View Cookies, and View Saved Passwords) does nothing (for this website, works for others).
4. Disabled all extensions and add-ons and tried again, no success.
5. Cleared all cookies for the paypal domain, still nothing.
6. Opened a Private Window from the same profile, still nothing.
7. Used a different profile, information is displayed normally (both next to the padlock, and on the Page Info tab, with website identity, privacy, technical details, etc.).



Actual results:

No information is displayed when clicking on the green padlock for that website, or on the Security tab of the Page Info window.

It only happens for this specific website (from all those I've tried, with https), and only on one specific profile (my main one).

The reason I'm filling the bug is because PayPal is a security-sensitive website, so I'd like to know if my profile could be corrupted or affected by some malware.

If there is a way to clean my profile other than starting from scratch, would gladly like to know. Otherwise, if there is a way to obtain debugging information, that would help.


Expected results:

Security information should be displayed normally in both profiles, or some error message should help explain why it can't be shown."

I'm one of an extremely small set of people that have patched the async tab switcher. The bus factor is very low, and that's super-problematic for such a critical piece of UI code.

I'd like to try to de-mystify this code as best as I can so that more people feel comfortable patching it.

In my mind, the first step there is to document the code as best I can. I'm thinking of doing an in-tree rst document at browser/base/content/docs/tabbrowser/async-tab-switcher.rst

I might also flesh out some of the inline comments in the code. I'm not sure if the SphinxJS stuff can pull things out of tabbrowser.xml yet, but that's worth exploring.

 ",un-blocklisted addon is not re-added in search service,"If an addon is blockisted, then un-blocklisted (e.g. via update), the engine is not added back into the search service.
It will get added back upon restart, so I suspect this is a low severity.  However, it may also be an issue for an addon that adds a search engine during an update (v1 doesn't have an engine, v2 does), which I'd give a higher severity for.
The reason is that it is seen by the search service as an upgrade and it attempts to upgrade an engine that it does not have.

Private browsing for some unexplained reason seems to be saving form data in select cases. I can see it in Gmail's subject field when composing then sending an email. There may be more forms where this happens but I'm unsure at the moment.

Checking the formhistory.sqlite with a utility afterward, the subject form entry in the db is retained.

Also I was wondering where does the cache, history, and form history get written to while in the mode? In sqlite temp tables then dumped at end of session? Because I thought it would hard only to write to memory for the entire duration of private browsing, since its causes very slow surfing when the cache memory pref is turned off by comparison. I know cookies are saved [I think in the original cookies.sqlite] but dumped after the session. And downloads are saved only in memory according to sdwilsh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compose an email in Gmail (haven't tried other webmails)
2. Include a subject then send
3. Close and reopen Firefox, then compose another message and check subject field's form history dropdown"

 ",Scrolling while in the search bar changes default search engine,"after the changes in bug 1460982 landed, when you have the search bar enabled and hover with your mouse over that element, the chosen default search engine will change when you start to scroll.

i managed to accidentally change my search engine a couple of times in the past days and couldn't pinpoint that to a particular action/behaviour until it came up in this thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/9ldc9i/scrolling_on_search_box_changes_search_engine_how/

i think it is an undesirable regression as there isn't really any UI that is making the user aware that a change in search engines is taking place which can lead to a degraded search experience (and lost revenue). also currently the switch is taking place between all installed search providers and not only the ones that are enabled and visibly displayed in the search bar as one-off search engines."

 ",IconURL not working with SearchEngines policy,"The IconURL setting doesn't appear to work with the SearchEngines Policy - using a policies.json containing something like:

{
  ""policies"": {
    ""SearchEngines"": {
      ""Add"": [
        {
          ""IconURL"": ""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAB...CYII="",
          ""Method"": ""GET"",
          ""Name"": ""Intranet Search"",
          ""URLTemplate"": ""http://intranet/search/getSearchForm?Search={searchTerms}""
        }
      ],
      ""Default"": ""Intranet Search"",
      ""PreventInstalls"": false
    }
  }
}

(IconURL base64 string reduced for brevity)

The new search engine is added, but uses a generic icon, not the one supplied

However, using an identical ""data:..."" URL in a Search Engine XML plugin with CCK2, and the supplied icon is used

Attached are two console logs with prefs:

 browser.search.log = true
 browser.policies.loglevel = debug

policies.log when using the above policies.json

cck2.log when using CCK2 with:

  ""searchplugins"": {
    ""Intranet Search"": ""resource://mpc/searchplugins/intranet.xml"",
  },
  ""defaultSearchEngine"": ""Intranet Search"",

The policies.log is missing the line like:

_setIcon: Setting icon url ""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."" for engine ""Intranet Search"".

The _setIcon: log output comes from 'setIcon: function
SRCH_ENG_setIcon()' in toolkit/components/search/nsSearchService.js -
the code does:

_setIcon: function SRCH_ENG_setIcon(aIconURL, aIsPreferred, aWidth,
aHeight) {
     var uri = makeURI(aIconURL);

     // Ignore bad URIs
     if (!uri)
       return;

     LOG(""_setIcon: Setting icon url \"""" + limitURILength(uri.spec) +
""\"" for engine \""""
        + this.name + ""\""."");

So I'm guessing that it is failing at makeURI() ???"

Two issues here really, but related.  It appears that Firefox ignores files used
or imported by CSS files.  The url() contents are not inspected, files
downloaded and the url rewritten.

csszengarden shows that as the whole CSS is not downloaded as thier mechanism
(and most others) use the @import within an inline css block.

http://www.castley.net/brog give another example where the CSS is loaded via the
 <link /> tag.  In this case the CSS file is downloaded, however the images used
by the CSS are not.  

Both of these cases are due to not processing the url() elements in the CSS and
both produce less than perfect results for the person saving the site.

First time you launch Firefox, the Import Wizard pop up. You can chose to import bookmarks from Internet Explorer or a HTML-file. Well that is good, but why can you not import backup-file from Firefox itself, i.e .json? Yeah sure this can be done manually from Bookmark library, but would be easier to import on first launch. Especially when it's possible to import from IE and HTML.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do a fresh install of Firefox.
2. Import Wizard popups
3. You are not able to import .json-files.
Actual Results:  
You are not able to import .json from the Import Wizard

Expected Results:  
You should be able to import json-bookmarks from the Import Wizard."

Author
Title (Form W-9 (Rev. December 2011))

Print the document.  The equations are incorrectly rendered.

This may be related to bug 875205, however, this bug seems to be specific to the printout and not everywhere.

It seems that the bug affects PDF viewer's download button only. I can retain the PDF by using Ctrl-S or right click > Save Page As??I tried a .zip, a .exe, and a .gz file from Mozilla FTP and the files are all retained.

Workaround
Disable browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel.

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is documented in [activity stream's documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/docs/v2-system-addon/data_events.md).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences or Activity Stream's settings.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

Yes, Nan Jiang is responsible.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction. (The request is for Cat3 but the only new collection here is of the new event. The client/impression is included by other collections)

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

No. This collection is permanent.

It might even be possible to reuse the existing FXA_PUSH_SCOPE_ACCOUNT_UPDATE message - the one used when a user verifies. FxA could just take this as meaning ""the account status changed in some way"" and discard the token and or certificate, which would then cause us to get an auth-error fetching a new one, and quickly enter the ""needs reauth"" state.

There seems to be a problem where starting private browsing while an edit box is open and canceling the navigate-away retains the page.  This may apply only to those like Yahoo mail with Javascript that checks for this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start composing an email in a Yahoo! email account.  Don't finish.
2. Start private browsing.
3. Either Firefox or Yahoo's javascript pops up an alert asking you if you're sure you want to navigate away from the page.
4. Click ""no""
5. The alert appears again, which is odd.
6. Click ""no""
7. You seem to enter private browsing, but the Yahoo tab is still open.



Expected Results:  
I expect that either this should cancel private browsing entirely until the problem is properly resolved, or that the state of the editing should be saved by Firefox so that it can be restored when private browsing is exited.

I'm not a security expert, but I'm wondering if this couldn't cause security problems.  Javascript (secretly) prevents private browsing from becoming fully private and monitors what you do."

* The ""Global Score threshold hit, triggering sync."" as we are applying records happens every time, so obviously is suspicious ;) Instrumenting the observers shows the source param is an empty string. IOW, our tracker isn't ignoring our own changes.

* A minor point, but the ""Updated bookmark"" log doesn't show the URL."

Steps to reproduce:

I did not anything, just Firefox updated current version to up to date v16.01.

 ",search suggestions in the awesome bar should include local search suggestions like all other access points,"We're not using suggestions from local search history, unlike searchbar/about:home/about:newtab.  We should be consistent here and use the same model as all other access points.

 ","Poll for missed FxA commands (eg, sent tabs) automatically","We've recently had a bug whereby push wasn't working on Nightly. We do have a fallback polling mechanism to try and deal with that, but it's only executed when the user explicitly does a ""sync now"". The end result is that send tab appears to be completely broken for Nightly users who don't ever hit ""send now"".
Push server issues will hopefully be rare, but it will never have 100% reliability. Thus, we should poll for missed commands more often. The exact frequency is TBD, but I'd expect that once per session would have mitigated our recent issue significantly. ""send tab is slow"" is a much better bug report to get than ""send tab doesn't work"" :)
Just because things can never be simple, we should also investigate what telemetry we have for this and create a dashboard with alerts - we should never need to rely on user bug reports to tell us push is broken.

Steps to reproduce:

Test Case: 

  1.  Open a new tab
  2.  Navigate to about:config and click I'll be careful, I promise
  3.  In the filter box type security.warn
  4.  Double click security.warn_entering_secure and security.warn_leaving_secure if the values are FALSE

  6.  Navigate to https://www.verisign.com and click OK/Continue if a warning appears
  7.  Click the BACK button and click OK/Continue if a warning appears

Be sure to set security.warn_leaving_secure and security.warn_entering_secure back to false by going back to the about:config tab and double clicking on it.



Actual results:

4  This step is incorrect as the values security.warn_entering_secure and security.warn_leaving_secure are already set true 
5.  After step 5 no security warning 
6.  After step 6 no security warning when you click back 
7.  After step 7 no security warning should appear when you click FORWARD

I have one more query to the developer who looks into this issue :  irrespective of we make the status of the values ""security.warn_entering_secure ""and ""security.warn_leaving_secure"" either  ""TRUE"" or  ""FALSE"" . It shows the same behavior.

so can you please double check such test cases and make sure that they are correct test cases and give clear understanding ? 


Expected results:


   1.   At step 5 , A security warning should appear when you access a secure site
   2.  After step 6 A security warning should appear when you click BACK

If you open the bookmarks properties dialog for a bookmark and try to add some tags, you have to hit enter to select the tag from the autocomplete list. Doing so will close the whole dialog immediately. That shouldn't happen. Instead the tag has to be completed.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add a bookmark by clicking the star and enter a tag e.g. ""bug""
2. Open the bookmarks sidebar and select properties from the newly added bookmark

buttons to dismiss or resize the window are off the screen, the only way to get
out of them is to quit Firebird.

I don???know if this is helpful or not but when the prefs dialog is too big, it
uses the new (Panther) sheet animation; when it???the right size, it uses the

 ",Firefox may generate invalid assertions.,"I've managed to reproduce desktop generating invalid assertions due to a happy confluence of unrelated bugs :)  This happens when multiple calls to getAssertion are in-flight at the same time - we may end up using a mismatched keypair and certificate.

I've instrumented my build to prove this and can see it happening, and I've outlined a theoretical failure scenario below - I'm not sure if that scenario is *exactly* what I reproduced, but it is close.

The issue stems from the fact that we persist the keypair and the certificate at different times, so this can get racey. The solution is probably fairly simple - only persist the certificate and keyPair together (ie, consider them atomic). This would still leave the potential for races, but at least whoeever wins the race would write consistent data.

Another thing we could do in addition is to try and avoid getAssertion calls racing by reusing the same promise when one is already in flight. The assertion itself also has a validity lifetime, so we could consider caching the last assertion we generated and reusing it while it is valid - but these are all optimizations rather than the correctness issue outlined above re storage.

Theoretical scenario:

    How getAssertion is implemented in desktop:
     
    getKeypair() {
        yield getStorage()
        if (storage.keyPair) {
            return storage.keyPair;
        }
        let keypair = yield generateKeyPair();
        yield setStorage(keypair=keypair, cert = null);
        return keypair;
    }
     
    getCert(keypair) {
        yield getStorage()
        if (storage.cert) {
            return storage.cert;
        }
        let cert = yield getCertificateSigned(sessionToken, keypair);
        yield setStorage(cert=cert);
        return cert;
    }
     
    getAssertion() {
        yield getStorage();
        let kp = yield getKeypair()
        let cert = yield getCert(kp);
        return getAssertionFromCert(keypair, cert);
    }
     
    Possible failure scenario:
     
    promise1:
    * enter getAssertion, enter getKeyPair, not found in storage so calls generateKeyPair().
    promise2:
    * (same) - enter getAssertion, enter getKeyPair, not found in storage so calls generateKeyPair().
    promise1:
    * saves keypair1
    promise2:
    * saves keypair2
    * saves cert2 (built from kp2) (ie, somehow this promise ""skipped ahead"" of promise 1.)
    promise1:
    * saves cert1 (built from kp1)
     
    Now in a state where we have cert1 and keypair2 in the storage, getAssertion generates an invalid one."

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

Session cookies are meant to identify a ""conversation"" between an agent and a
webpage in a unique way. Currently (FireFox 0.9.1) a session cookie that is
created on one tab, will be sent back to the website when it is accessed by a
different tab. Even two separate browser instances seem to ""share"" session
cookies. This is a bug. It is impossible to use 2 separate running copies of
FireFox to maintain 2 separate ""sessions"" on a given website. This is very bad,
and needs to be fixed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a webpage that uses a session cookie.
2. Use another instance of FireFox to access the same webpage.
3. Notice that you are using the same ""session"".

Actual Results:  
Session cookies are shared across browser instances.

Expected Results:  
ANY cookie with a maximum age of 0 should be considered a session cookie, and
should only be sent back to the originating website by the window that created
it. Other tabs, or running copies of FireFox should NOT send session cookies
that they did not originally accept.

This may cause much trouble in web-applications because often data is saved to
the ""session"". This can cause any data stored in the session to become available
to another browser instance. This is a major flaw that can cause web
applications to fail."

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Events.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 80.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :ewright is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 80.

 ","New Dropdown for Quicksearch Box is extremely ugly, big and waste of space. And breaks apple UI consistency.","In the recent RC2, the Themeing of the search-dropdown-box (""google"" etc) has
been  changed to look somewhat aqua-ish. 

Problem 1: Dropdown-Boxes in OSX do not look this way (see the aqua widgets for
the select element in safari). They have a coloured handle (including the
triangle) and a black label on whitish background (never an icon, though). For
examples see:
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/XHIGControls/chapter_10_section_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000359/TPXREF132

Problem 2: The old (pre RC2) widget (simple triangle) was an already existing
solution. It is used in the finder, in iTunes, in Apple Mail and it is still
used in Thunderbird. It is always used to specify a search context - so why
should it not be used in this place?

Problem 3: It is ugly. By its extreme bevel the dropdown handle sets itself atop
all other UI-Elements although it is just a search-modifier, not an important
action button. Please safe us from eye-cancer and return to the old style. It
looks just beatiful in the location bar. 

Problem 4: It is unnecessary. If we want to enlarge the clickable area or to
direct the user to this nice firefox feature (we don't need to, almost every OSX
program has such a box), we can use a shaded background wich is cut of to the
right by a straight vertical edge and fills up to the left. It could have the
same color as the tabs.

I'd really like to mark this bug as blocker, but I know there's a lot of work
already so we should do it when there is spare time."

This happens the first time the current session is saved (so a few seconds after the initial startup) while calling _ensureInitialized in SessionCookies.jsm.

The cookies being deleted here are the non-session cookies, which obviously aren't in the session cookies store, so for each of them _ensureMap uselessly creates empty map objects.

I think we should create a different code path for initializing SessionCookie.jsm, so that we can avoid calling _updateCookie here.

I haven't dug any further, but do note that I only noticed this due to error logs being written, which is the last line above - but that's actually a bug that we fixed in bug 1262329 (there was no error setting previousFailed) - so we should also consider having the WARN with the specific error message log at the ERROR level so this kind of problem always creates error logs.

Flagging as P1 because this relates to a system addon rather than one the user chose to install, so it's reasonable to speculate many users have this problem."

 ",Don't treat children moved out of a deleted synced folder as orphans,"Rebecca and I uncovered this today. If you manually move all children out of a folder, then delete the old folder on one side, we'll merge the children twice: once when we walk the new folder, and again when we walk the unchanged, old folder on the other side to check for orphans.

This causes us to treat the already-merged children as orphans, insert two conflicting nodes for each child into the merged tree, and throw a constraint violation when we try to insert that structure into SQLite.

The fix is to bail and ignore already-merged children when checking for local deletions of a remote node, or remote deletions of a local node."

(Not sure if this is a bug or expected behaviour... but it's a mixed bag in the upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0alpha)

I have a fairly large history(~60MB places.sqlite), in fx2.0 and earlier the history feature was pretty much unusable(too slow , too much memory) due to the large size. But the URL auto-completion in the address/location field worked fine with a pause of maybe a couple of seconds(which was acceptable for the volume of data).

In Fx3.0 thanks to sqlite , the history feature (Ctrl-H) is finally usuable, (a LOT faster than before)

But the URL autocompletion has slowed down like crazy, the UI freezes for many seconds (20-30 seconds on average sometimes as high as a minute.) after I type the first letter. During which time there is plenty of disk activity(a constant read of ~600kb/sec) and minimal CPU activity.

Trying to go to a URL started with a different letter immediately after this results in a similiar amount of delay.

I have plenty of free RAM but the sqlite database doesn't seem to be cached. And is being read from disk again even though it hasn't been modified.

But the latest query results seem to be cached and typing the same character again shows up the auto-complete options almost instantly.

Similarly for the history too , hitting Ctrl-H ...results in the database being read from disk .. and then high CPU activity while the history tree is being generated.

Closing the history sidebar and immediately hitting Ctrl-H a second time, results in data being read from disk once again and then high CPU load as the history tree is generated again.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with a large history file (places.sqlite > 60MB)
2. hit the first letter to a URL, (say ""p"")
3. (long pause while auto-complete information is being retreived, UI freezes/browser is unresponsive, constant disk activity around 600kb/sec)

-- continuing on--

4. Do not go to any site, instead clear the typed letter ""p"" and change it to ""s""

Saving a page to Pocket or bookmarking a page will both run an animation on the Library button. The code to implement this animation is duplicated for each one so that Pocket's implementation can be independent since it is installed as a system-addon and not integrated fully with the product.

In this case, `nsINavBookmarkService.moveItem` will throw, since roots can't be moved...but Sync will still change the root's GUID!

These arrow buttons were introduced in bug 1501985. A screen reader user cannot be sure what these buttons will do, since they are unlabelled and don't indicate that they can be expanded. This might mean screen reader users are never aware there is additional information and controls that can be accessed.
This can be solved by:

Giving these arrow buttons an accessibility label; e.g. aria-label=""More information"".
Indicating on the button whether the content is expanded or collapsed using aria-expanded. For example, this would default to aria-expanded=""false"" and then change to aria-expanded=""true"" when the button is activated.

Ideally, for each such event we would be able to identify the submitting device id, thanks to the device_id field in the sync ping.
This redash query explores what percentage of events do not have an associated submitting device id. Prior to April 14th 2020 this was hovering at less than 1%, which I think can be safely explained by the known cases in which we can't submit a device-id. But after April 14th we see a significant increase, to around 4%.
What's the source of this increase, and how do we fix it? Our first clue might be that it started a few days after the release of Firefox 75, but from slack conversations, we haven't been able to think of anything in that release that might have caused it.
(The graph shows a second increase in early May, which has since subsided back to the ~4% level; this was almost certainly caused by Bug 1636053 and has been resolved)

"Address Bar
 ","History sidebar slow for ""By Most Visited"" and ""By Last Visited""","Bug 385245 complained about slow history sidebar. The latest patch in this bug solves performance problem of ""By Site"", ""By Date"" and ""By Date and Site"". However, it does not improve ""By Most Visited"" and ""By Last Visited"". As the number of days in history has increased from 9 to 180, the amount of data increased too.

While we could probably get some speed improvements in the javascript code to slightly improve the performance, with many sites it would be still slow. A solution would be to introduce some kind of grouping.

By Last Visited
---------------
We should group max visits in the same way as ""By Date"" groups all visits. However, instead of sorting by title inside of the date range, we would sort by last visit descending.

By Most Visited
---------------
We should group by the number of visits. I suggest something like this:

Top Visited Pages 
  - p(v) > 99th percentile
Most Visited Pages 
  - 99th percentile >= p(v) > 95th percentile
Commonly Visited Pages
  - 95th percentile >= p(v) > 50th percentile
Rarely Visited Pages
  - p(v) <= 50th percentile
Never Visited Pages
  - this could be imported but never visited bookmarks

Where ""v"" is number of visits. ""p(v)"" is the percentile - what is the percentage of places having ""v"" number of visits and less. Most likely users would only click on ""Top Visited Pages"" what would load quickly as there is only 1% of places.

This grouping will only be shown if you have more than 100 places.

Both can be implemented very easily on top of bug 385245. No changes on UI are required (apart of the new strings)."

Build ID: 20170302120751

Steps to reproduce:

I have a bookmark whose URL starts with: http://[ and is a wrong/invalid URL.

This bookmark was created with an older version of Firefox (I believe 45 or 35).

It noticed that it is not possible to enter such an URL when creating a new bookmark now, but when I upgraded to the current version no problems occured (like telling me that I can not upgrade because of invalid bookmark URLs).

In summary: I presume that the validation rules for bookmark URLs have been made stricter, since somehow I could enter this URL with my old firefox Version which I now can not reproduce.


Actual results:

I can not delete the bookmark. When clicking ""Delete"" in the context-menu, nothing happens. 

In the ""Library"" when I try to select the bookmark, the row is selected but the fields below showing the Name, Location and Tags are not updated (they are filled with the previous selection)

When I try to edit the bookmark via clicking ""Properties"" in the context-menu, an empty dialog opens (see attached screenshot).

IMPORTANT NOTE: I had the exact same behaviour already BEFORE upgrading.


Expected results:

1.) Either it should not be possible to simply import / migrate data (in my case invalid bookmark URLs) from an older version which do not fulfill the validation rules anymore. Maybe the user could have been informed about this during the upgrade.

2.) Or, when somehow an invalid URL makes it into a bookmark, it should still be possible to delete that entry. Furthermore, the properties dialog looks really ""broken"" beeing completely blank while still showing a ""Save"" button. This should be fixed."

The real solution here is to do the following:

We should create some infrastructure to do this in the content process, and start moving things out of the main scripts into separate scripts that are only used when needed.

One slightly difficult aspect is that the existing implementation in nsBrowserGlue doesn't cover the case for event listeners, and when we do that, we'll need to pay attention into the cases where it's just a function (to call it directly) vs. when it's an object with handleEvent.

 ",[meta] Unintentional collection of user-edited search engine values,"We discovered that we have been unintentionally receiving unwanted data in some of our search telemetry for Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android (Fenix), and Focus for Android. Although the situation in which this occurs is rare, we believe it is important to do a full assessment and take action. This bug tracks those efforts.
Cause
In order to allow attribution of search by our partners, each partner assigns Firefox one or  more ??諛팤rch codes?? This search code appears in the URL as an HTTP query parameter. Firefox Telemetry reports ??諛팤rch code??counts in order to help us ensure that the correct codes are being sent. This helps us detect defects as well as search engine ???쓏acking??by malware. We discovered some instances in which we believe, if a user (typically accidentally) edited that part of the URL, then the contents of that field were sent back in Telemetry. For instance, if the search code was ??瑗뭨efox??and the user pasted an email address ??湲퉍mple@example.com??into that part of the URL this was reported as the search code ??瑗뭨eexample@example.comfox??
Note that search codes are not search queries (i.e. what you searched for). Unless edited as above, they do not include any unique or identifying information.
Impact
Our investigation found that the unwanted data was rare ??a maximum of 0.0013% of recorded events on Firefox Desktop, 0.0005% on Firefox for Android, and 0.0057% on Firefox Focus for Android. This matches our expectations given that the conditions described above are difficult to trigger. Firefox on iOS and Focus on iOS have a different implementation of the telemetry and are unaffected.
Mitigation Plan
In Firefox 96.0.3 we will be pushing a fix that limits collecting codes to a known list. This will still allow us to investigate potential search hijacking by malware by targeting specific values but will stop the unwanted collection of data. We have also started removing all submitted values not on the known list when the data is received by our telemetry servers. We will additionally remove all unknown values from existing data, which we expect to be completed by the end of February.
The update for clients landed on Nightly on January 25. Updates will start shipping January 27 on Release and ESR channels:

Firefox Desktop (Bug 1751746)
Firefox for Android, Firefox Focus (Bug 1751920)

In addition, we will be disabling telemetry collection for this value entirely on older Firefox versions back to Firefox 83, which is the earliest version where that change can be made with remote configuration. We encourage people with versions of Firefox older than 96.0.3 to update their version of Firefox.

I think what's happening here is the user was never intended to be allowed to go back to the previous slide, but we're using pagination dots to indicate progress/steps remaining. In my opinion pagination dots are meant to be interactive (see iOS homescreen, web carousels), so if we are explicitly not allowing the user to go back to the previous slide another UI element may be better suited for this (e.g. progress bar, maybe even numbered steps).

 ",Add a mozscreenshots configuration for control center,"Since we'll be touching control center again, it would help with ui-review and catching regressions if we add a configuration to mozscreenshots to capture images of the UI.

We should probably include images with the following things:
* Tracking protection on and disabled
* Site permissions specified and not specified
* Opening the subviews
* Different security states (e.g. HTTPS, HTTP, trusted about pages, file:, etc.)

Of course anything is better than nothing so we can do what's simplest first.

We can combine combinations of these into one screenshot where it makes sense (to not lose useful coverage) like we do for Tabs.jsm. Perhaps the last one should be its own configuration JSM (or part of Tabs.jsm) that you can combine with the control center one to get all of the combinations.

This just requires adding a file to https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/tools/mozscreenshots/mozscreenshots/extension/configurations/ and writing a function for each image which returns a promise when the UI is ready to be captured.

 ",A valid XHTML document is parsed wrongly when using a short XML element notation,"User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217

A valid XHTML 1.0 strict document is parsed wrongly and an invalid DOM tree is 
built in recent Gecko based browsers when the document contains an anchor 
element coded in short notation (<a name=""a1""/>). Although the given example 
contains only one anchor named 'a1', DOM tree contains 5 such elements - as can 
be seen in DOM Inspector.

As a consequence, the page layout is affected by the extraordinary elements.

This issue was tested in recent Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 
5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0) and Mozilla (Mozilla/5.0 
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217) on Windows 2000 
and Windows XP, every time with the same result.

The problem disappears, when the short notation of anchor element is replaced 
by an opening and ending tags.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL
2. Open DOM Inspector
3. Compare the occurrences of <a name=""a1""> in DOM Inspector and the page source

Actual Results:  
DOM Inspector shows elements which do not exist in the source document.

Expected Results:  
A valid document should be parsed correctly."

Steps to reproduce:

./firefox --window-size=1280,1024 -screenshot test.png mozilla.org

*directly gives back control to the shell, due to invisible popup*


Actual results:

It makes a screenshot and then never quits. 

There is no way to quit firefox after making a screenshot except signals like killall/control-c. Killing it places firefox in a ""closed unexpected"" mode. While in this mode no screenshots are made given there is an (invisible) dialog that needs to be clicked away (""A copy of Firefox is already open. Only one copy of Firefox can be open at a time."").

When the ""unexpected"" dialog is open, making a screenshot again results in being returned to my shell, while there is a firefox process that waits idle until someone clicks an invisible dialog.

Using windowed mode the message can be clicked away. But it will re-appear due to needing to stop firefox.


Expected results:

Dialogs should never appear as there is no UI: dismiss all and make a screenshot in one of the following ways.

A: Make a screenshot and then quit, let me wait until the screenshot is finished. This is by far the easiest for shell integration. Which was the goal here.

B: Leave firefox open, but accept more commands (screenshot, quit) in some documented way from the command line. This requires some more tricky programming to control it programmatically."

How well does it work?: 100%

Steps to reproduce working features:
* Tab extra commands / properties -> right click on any tab and select the TMP-added menu items, such as ""Protect"" or ""Lock"", then try to close the tab or load a link to a different page in the same tab (both actions should fail)
* Link navigation behavior: in a content page featuring both external and internal links, try different click variants (right/left/middle, with or without modifier) to test consistency with the behavior configured in TMP options.
* UI enhancements: try enabling some from TMP's options panel, and check whether they're reflected in Firefox's tab strip


Steps to reproduce broken features: ---

Any obvious performance problems? no

javascript: urls that return a html page when visited currently produce a history entry just like normal urls... while this may be desired for the classical history view, it's very dangerous that these urls end up in the address bar suggestion list as these entries can be made to look just like the real page, including FavIcon, Title and a pseudo url that only differs from the real url in that http:// is replaced with javascript:'//. However opening the javascript: url will execute it in the scope of the currently viewed page, thereby exposing all sensitive data on the page to the javascript code. I think javascript: urls should only be viewed in the suggestion list when they actually are bookmarklets and the user has made a conscious effort to add them, not when he just happened to come by one (which he may not even has noticed, the javascript: url in the sample is opened by an onclick handler and redirects to the correct page).

A simple filter for the suggestion box to not include history entries that start with javascript: should already be sufficient.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://tapper-ware.net/devel/js/historypoisoning/
2.Click on the link (http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9872464-38.html)
3.Open a new tab and start typing ""news"" into the addressbar
Actual Results:  
The javascript url appears in the suggestion list as ""[CNet Icon] news.com BitTorrent firms: Comc(...)"" with url ""javascript:'//www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9872464-38.html______(...)""

Expected Results:  
The real news.com page should be the only listed suggestion as the javascript url is not a location that can safely be visited.

The favicon doesn't always work... I'm still trying to figure out when it does and when it doesn't but while it may be relevant to the practical severity of this bug, it doesn't change anything for the underlying flaw."

Any of:

2a. right click the home page text box
2b. go to security > saved logins, right click the search box

On OS X, the first looks vaguely OK, though I can't shake the feeling it's not quite right. Maybe someone with better eyes for this kind of thing can point out what's wrong. On Windows 8, it seems the context menu doesn't have nearly enough padding, with the focus rectangle on ""Select All"" overlapping with the last 'l', and the menu generally not being as wide as menus anywhere else (seems there should be a minimum width of some sort?).

2b uses overly large fonts on both OSes. More noticeable on OS X because the actual size of the menu ends up being wrong, but even on Windows we seem to be using a much larger font than we should be.

Philipp, is this something you'd be interested in writing a patch for? :-)"

Hello, 

i've looked in my AVAST Antivirus Programm an i see, that firefox realy reads hunderts of thousends of small files... that really bad for hardisk performance. 
I think on the low speed harddrives in notebooks... and not good against fragement building on harddisk...

why firefox doesn't store the content of the Plugin in DB like SQLlite? (for places for exampled quite fast (with my 1.400 bookmarks :-))

firefox has really many extensions i use and this slows down the starup performance extremly! (because of loading so many files, before the window is shown) 

the layout of firefox should be cached (Traybar and so on) then you could show the main window really fast, because the functions could be load later, i think firefox use late binding? 

only some minds about performance... - never forget performance is the key! :-)

 ",Couple Awesome Bar Composition (matchBuckets pref) to user's Address bar state (unified vs. 2 bar),"In 57, we now have the option of a unified bar or two separate bars (address bar + legacy search bar). Existing profiles kept 2 bars, new installs got unified by default. Users can change to the other figuration at any time in Settings > Search.

The default Awesome Bar composition in Fx is 5 history results, then 4 search suggestions. Existing users still see this. For new, unified installs in 57, we use Shield to dynamically alter the Awesome Bar search-first, which is the expectation many new users have.

Objective:
This work is to formalize that by coupling the Awesome Bar composition prefs to the state of the User's bar configuration.


Requirements:
The pref that controls Bar unification is: 
`browser.search.widget.inNavBar` 
False = unified. True = 2 bars. 


When users have unified bar, their composition should be set to 4 search results, 5 history.
This is achieved by setting: 
browser.urlbar.matchBuckets  = suggestion:4, general:5  (NOTE: this pref does not exist by default in Fx)


When users have 2 bar Firefox, they should see 5 history results, then 4 search (if available). This is current state and achieved by setting:

browser.urlbar.matchBuckets = general:5 
(or
browser.urlbar.matchBuckets = general:5, suggestion:4)"

 ",Switching from remote logon to direct logon causes machine crash,"Firefox 1 and Thunderbird with latest downloads from your site.
Client Machine-Sony Vaio VGN A290, XP SP2 Dual monitor
Host machine MSI Bookshelf, XP SP2
Belkin KVM 
100 mbs ethernet, ms firewall and symantec av on all machines
Host machine running Direcway v 4.2.1

I was running Firefox and Thunderbird on the host remotely using a remote
desktop connection from the client machine. There were two logons on the
host....an administrator running the direcway navigator and domino server v
6.5.2 and the remote connection with user client privelege.

I switched the monitor and kb to the host for a direct logon without
disconnecting the remote session. I do this all the time without incident.

Strange things happened.....several error messages as the host shutdown and
rebooted.

I was not able to get the host to run after this until I restored to a date
before firefox and thunderbird were loaded. 

Before the restore the host would just randoomly halt and reboot.

Nornally I would reproduce this several times before reporting, but this is just
too scary.....I have run in this configuration for several months without a
problem. The host is a stable machine that has run flawlessly for over 3 years.
It seems to be running ok now that firefox and thunderbird have been removed and
the system restored."

Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0 (release version)

I updated from Firefox 2.0.0.14 to Firefox 3.0.  I immediately noticed that my Bookmarks were missing and the search engine manager was non-functional.  I downgraded back to version 2.0.0.14 and all is fine.

I ran Firefox 3 on a client Mac OS X 10.5.3.  My home directory (and thus my Firefox profile) is on an XServe running OS X 10.5.3 Server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Replace version 2.0.0.14 with version 3.0
2. Start FireFox
3.
Actual Results:  
Bookmarks were not visible under bookmarks menu.  Search engine field had a generic icon and when I selected 'Manage search Engines', the dialog box was frozen and couldn't get out of it without quitting Firefox.

Expected Results:  
I expected my preferences to be intact (i.e., Bookmarks to appear in Bookmark menu and choice of search engine to be maintained, or at the very least fixable).

As is, I find Firefox 3 to be unusable.  I'll stay with Firefox2 for now."

I was browsing some dark backward part of the net and suddenly everything slowed
down and the hard disk became quite active, which usually means the Java VM has
started up. After a bit, I got some cryptic error that I can't recall, and
closed the window. I continued on with my business for a bit until I needed to
browse My Computer. When I opened it, however, it immediately closed down and I
realized that somehow I had been infected with some evil browser-hijacker.
AdAware confirmed this (some CasinoPalazzo thing, log included). I suppose I
could have been duped by some fake error message working through Java that
allowed me to install this. Is this a Java bug? Should I update my VM? Either
way, Java ought to be disabled by default (if it isn't already) and some warning
included in the options pannel.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
I've included AdAware logs. I bet they could provide you with the exact files if
needed.
Actual Results:  
Symptoms associated with use of IE.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should do better than this.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 MultiZilla/1.7.0.2d

When u view some pages with many pics, then mozilla will consume much more
memory than it tends to use. This causes a problem as follow: memory consuming
could exceed to the extent of all ur memory & virtual memory. I think the most
likely causes of this is that mozilla & firefox use some technology as Internet
Explorer buffering pics as their bitmap form. But how can we solve this problem?
Sacrificing the browsing speed to solve the problem? I think it's no need to
sacrifice the speed. We can let the user set the memory max consumption of
memory which can be set to a recommended value. Then surfing online, mozilla can
decide which page buffer the images, which not. So at most situations mozilla
can buffer all the pics, but at some special cases such as browsing tons of
pics, mozilla can also do well, just a little bit slower, & I think slower is
better than hanging there till crash!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mozila suite or mozilla firefox
2.use one of them to browse many pages with tons of pics, don't close the pages
u opened before, I think opening 10-20pages is enough. 
3.u can see the memory consumption is surprisingly unbelievable. 

Actual Results:  
u at last to kill the mozilla

Expected Results:  
to find out whether the page consumes too much memory on buffering. If it up to
some extent, the mozilla won't buffer for that page. Memory is limited. If keep
cunsuming as mozilla does now, the memory would be used up & operating system
would use virtuall memory for mozilla's buffering, & that shows no sence for
speed promotion.

I think it's because of the mozilla's buffering module. Just don't buffer
everything can be buffered. The memory is not so big that u can't buffer every pics."

that it was firefox so I tested on a clean windows xp vmware installation with
the latest firefox 1.0pr and 0.10.1 security patch and was able to duplicate it.

just telling me an old javascript exploit was in my cache.  I thought about this
before reporting this possible bug and then I thought I might as well give
someone a heads up.

When the attached test case is loaded, say in tab 1, it uses window.open() from a load even handler on the document body to open a second tab, say tab 2. The test case loaded in tab 1 also has an onunload handler on the document body that invokes ""window.close()"" on tab 2 when tab 1 is unloaded. The intention is that closing tab 1 will also close tab 2. However, in the current trunk build closing tab 1 causes the entire browser to exit even if other tabs are open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached test case - this will cause an additional tab to open.
2. Open another at least one other tab so you now have at least 3 tabs open.
3. Close the tab with the test case loaded it it.
Actual Results:  
The whole browser exits

Expected Results:  
The tab with the test case in it should close along with the additional tab the test case opened - however any other tabs should remain open.

 ","Regression: New ""New Tab""-buttons lost all of their drop-zone features that were introduced in Firefox 1.5","User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20090123 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre

The ""New Tab"" button used to be a drag and drop zone just like the ""New Window"" button still is. The code for this has been removed when the new ""New Tab"" button on the tab-bar was introduced and hasn't been re-added since.

It used to be possible to drag just about everything on the button and it would open in a new tab: bookmarks, text-urls, urls, pictures, currently open tabs (which would then be duplicated in a new tab) or even simple text (which would result in an ""I'm feeling lucky"" search).
This excellent feature has been introduced in Firefox 1.5 and was fully functional until the recent ""New Tab""-button redesign.
It is still possible with the ""New Window"" button but impossible with both the ""New Tab""-button on the tab-bar and the recently re-added custom ""New Tab"" button. It should be fully functional for ALL THREE buttons.

In order to actually be fully functional with the new ""New Tab"" button on the tab-bar not only has the old code to be re-added to the button, it also has to be slightly redesigned since it is much too small to be usable as a drop zone in case of overflow. And consistent size without shrinking it in case of overflow would solve this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drop anything (bookmark, url, text, open tab) onto either of the two ""New Tab"" Buttons
2. Drop anything (bookmark, url, text, open tab) onto the ""New Window"" button
Actual Results:  
1. A ""forbidden"" icon appears when trying to drop anything on the ""New Tab"" button in the ""Navigation Toolbar"".
The current tab is moved next to the ""New Tab"" button on the tab-bar instead of being duplicated (it's just like the button isn't there but as if something is simply dropped onto the tab-bar itself).
2. Everything is functioning they way it should with all three buttons

Expected Results:  
Firefox should attempt to open anything dropped on either of these buttons in a new tab. A currently opened tab dropped onto either of the buttons should be duplicated in a new tab."

 ",Determine shipping strategy for Firefox Monitor,"I'm opening this bug to track the effort to land the UI code for the Firefox Monitor project into m-c.

Before we start on a patch, I want to gather some opinions on how we want to ship this. The two routes I see are a) system add-on, b) bake into browser code.

Arguments in favor of system add-on:
- The UI is really not functional or useful without the accompanying web service (or tool, or whatever you want to call it - I'm sticking with service for now), so I see elegance in shipping this in a self-contained manner. This will make it much easier to maintain as the service evolves.
- There is strong motivation to ship this in 62, and I feel better about uplifting this into beta as a system add-on.
- The code so far is already built as a WebExtension, so system add-on means less engineering effort to port it, which is important considering the timeline.

Arguments against system add-on:
- From what I gather, the general sentiment is against this approach and I hesitate to create disturbance in the Force.
- Performance concerns (though FWIW, this is not a startup-sensitive feature and if we can defer loading it that is absolutely fine).


Johann: needinfo'ing you to sanity-check the arguments in favor of the system add-on route, since you know the project fairly well at this point I think.

Florian: needinfo'ing you to get your opinion on ""yet another system addon"". Could you lay out the exact perf concern (I believe it's about browser startup performance) and whether it's possible to avoid it by loading this add-on lazily?

Also, a general plea: if you have additional arguments for either side please share, and if there's anyone in particular that I missed whose opinion is important here, please add them to the conversation. Thanks!"

NOTE: I have experienced the following on 6 uniquely different systems, ranging from 1.5ghz 256mb ram to 3.2ghz 4gig ram

Other applications open: none other than bare system software (e.g. window manager)
System state: ranging from fresh install to couple months old
system resource usage before: load average: 0.01, cpu usage: 0.5%

after opening firefox and loading a couple of tabs (max of 7):
cpu usage: at LEAST 60%, load average: 4.xx

resourse usage of firefox being left idle for an hour: no change

after firefox either crashes and closes itself, or stops responding and is force killed, or in the rare instance it accepts a standard quit message:
same resource usage as before using firefox. In Windows it can often be impossible to kill firefox in this state and requires a hard reset (as firefox is using almost 4 gig of memory on that system!!!!!!)

Example pages: Google, Gmail, Hotmail, MySpace, Youtube, Facebook, and almost any other site with moderate usage of images and/or css and/or javascript

Most noticable performance bottleneck: loading pages, closing pages(freeing up memory - can take some minutes to close after receiving a quit message), or switching between tabs. Can take substantial time to switch/render the tab (tespite the tab control responding instantly). closing a tab can also take substantial time despite the cross responding to the click.
Sometimes using the scrollwheel on an un-rendered tab causes the rendering engine to kick in instantly

Number of times Firefox ate up massive system resources and stopped responding/disappeared trying to get to this site alone: 3

Operating systems this has happened on are Windows (XP/Vista), Ubuntu Linux (Hardy), Debian Linux (Etch)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox and watch system resources


Expected Results:  
Firefox consumes an acceptable amount of resources as Firefox 2.0.0.14 did"

 ","[Sync Tabs Sidebar] Sidebar and panel ""sync now"" buttons should use the same terminology","[Sync Tabs] has ""Sync Now"" as a sync option and the same option in [Sync Tabs Sidebar] is called Refresh. The UI should be kept similar as much as possible for usability sake since it's basically the same feature from sync point of view.

Another note here against using ""Refresh"" as a label for sync in this case is that when you sync the Sync Tabs Sidebar you do it vs the cloud and not actually versus another device/machine. The user might be mislead to think that pressing Refresh will bring the new tabs he changed on the target machine without syncing before the target.

Therefore, for the above reasons I would suggest at least renaming the ""Refresh"" option from Sync Sidebar to ""Sync Now""."

Steps to reproduce:
This occurs on Firefox on Windows 10.
Unfortunately I've had issues reliably reproducing this issue, but it typically occurs when I'm reorganizing a large number of bookmarks. I've had a similar issue delete a massive number of bookmarks back when Sync was relatively new, but hoped/assumed it had been fixed until I ran into the same issue again recently.
Actual results:
If I create folders with identical names under differently named hierarchies such as:

Folder1/SubFolder1/Instructions/
Folder2/SubFolder2/Instructions/

...Firefox Sync will oftentimes mix-up the contents of the two folders, or the bookmarks within will disappear or return to their original location if I moved them from another folder.
I have found that renaming the folders so that they are truly globally unique helps, but I'm often adding an abbreviation of the hierarchy to the ends of folder names, which feels unnecessary and tedious. I'm also concerned about losing a massive amount of bookmarks again as the automated backups from sync do not seem to capture bookmarks moved or created in this instance.
Expected results:
I expected that the contents of each matching folder name with different parental hierarchies remain consistent with where I place/create/move them. Bookmarks should not be lost or restored to their original location if moved.

However, Tabbrowser is a challenge for a couple of reasons:
 - Until now, we've been trying hard not to break compatibility for tabbrowser. It's up in the air whether or not we're going to stick to that policy for Fx 4.
 - The bindings xul structure should probably remain in xbl - or at least parts of them.

 ",Discovery stream does not clear store if pref changes to on,"Not a huge concern, because it's only an issue while manually changing your preff from an on state to another on state.
If we go from discovery stream off to discovery stream on via pref change, things work as expected. When it is enabled, we clear cache and fetch new data. This works fine because it was previously off and thus the store would by default b empty.
If we go from discovery stream on to discovery stream off, we clear cache and clear the store. Also works as expected.
If we're changing the pref from an on state to another on state (example, turn spocs on from off) We clear cache and fetch new data. The issue here is if Discovery Stream was already on, we already have something in state which also loads.
To test:

Turn on discovery stream via setting browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.discoverystream.config to {""api_key_pref"":""extensions.pocket.oAuthConsumerKey"",""enabled"":true,""show_spocs"":false,""layout_endpoint"":""https://getpocket.com/v3/newtab/layout?version=1&consumer_key=$apiKey&layout_variant=basic""}
Use a slow layout, dev-test-feeds probably works best.
Open a new tab.

Expected: You should see nothing but search while it loads.
Actual: You see top sites while it loads. If the layout was a bit different, things might jump around the screen. This is because when it tries to render, it checks to see if we're able to load data, and even thought the feeds are still loading, the jsx sees old stuff in the cache thus tries to display an older layout.

Spec: https://github.com/vtsatskin/FX-Captive-Portals-Design/blob/master/design/spec.md

As part of Firefox's Captive Portal Design, this bug adds OSX Captive Network Assistant observation events and detects when Captive Network Assistant failed.

Starting in Mac OS X 10.7, a window appears when a captive portal has been detected by the OS.

This may cause duplicated captive portals on the screen. If it's possible, Firefox should watch to see if Captive Network Assistant opens a captive portal. If it does, there is no need to automatically open it in Firefox. However, if the system does not properly detect a captive portal, Firefox should behave as defined in this spec.

For users, the outcome is that if an OSX-level Captive Portal is visible, a captive portal does not automatically open in Firefox.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Firefox determines if an OSX-level captive portal is visible to the user in the foreground.
- If the user logs into the OSX-level captive portal, Firefox never automatically opens the captive portal in a tab.
- If the user does not log into the OSX-level captive portal, Firefox automatically opens a tab in the active window with a captive portal"

Steps to reproduce:

I inserted an url into the location bar.
example: http://drupal.org/project/views

I wanted to modify part of the url so I navigated to the beginning of the url (Home) and advanced to a certain position with the arrow keys.
example: 'http' => 'https'
therefore: [Home] [->] [->] [->] [->] [s]

The url suggestions appeared after a short delay, but I wanted to modify the url some more so I tried navigating to the next position.
[->]......

The suggestion list - and the bug - sometimes appears as soon as after hitting [Home].
I suppose it depends on some timeout and the speed of interaction.


Actual results:

Upon pressing the right arrow, the cursor jumps to the end of the line instead of the next character location.

This would be the right thing if I selected an element from the suggestion list - replace with the selected and jump to the end - but I did not select anything.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050724 Firefox/1.0+

When you try to install an extension when Software Installation is disabled
(through Preferences), Firefox displays the notification bar that says that
Software Installation is disabled, and to click ""Edit Options..."" to enable it
and try again.  However, the text of the button is ""undefined"", not ""Edit
Options..."" on Mac OS X.  It does seem to be correct using Deer Park Alpha 2 on
Windows XP, but not on recent nightlies on Mac OS X.

I will attach a screenshot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable Software Installation on the Content pane of Preferences.
2. Navigate to a page with an install link for installing an extension.
3. Click the install link (attempt to install the extension).

Actual Results:  
The notification bar appears, saying to click ""Edit Options..."" and try again,
but there is no such button.  The button text says ""undefined"".

Expected Results:  
The button text should be ""Edit Options..."", based on the text of the notification.

I didn't know which component this best fits under, since the notifcation bar
doesn't have its own component, and I wasn't sure if it's an Extension Manager
or not, so I apologize if this is in the wrong component."

The following link 

<a href=""http://www.firefox.com"" onclick=""return false;"">Show Bug</a>

has the onclick attribute set in order to define an event handler. Here, the handler just returns false to ask the UA to cancel the default event action.[*]

Now press a modifier key while clicking on the link and suddenly the link can be activated: it may open in a tab or even in a new window.



[*] Of course, it does not make any sense to have a link that can not be activated but it's just there as proof of concept.

Firefox 3.0.1 does continuously modify places.sqlite and places.sqlite-journal while tabs are open and the browser is otherwise idle (tcpdump shows no firefox related activity).
This happens at irregular intervals of a few minutes, usually at least once within five minutes.
This prevents the use of disk spin down on laptops and thus causes reduced battery life.

A sample of the changed values in the database from ""diff -u"" is given below:

This means that the frecency entries of moz_places is modified. This modification should only be done when the browser becomes active e.g. when a wb page is reloaded.

Yes. This collection can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

Yes, Nan Jiang is responsible.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 1, Technical.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

"PDF Viewer
 ",Split browser.display.use_document_fonts between HTML and PDF,"The PDF viewer (pdf.js) reuses the browser.display.use_document_fonts preference to decide whether the fonts in the PDF file should be used or not. There are absolutely no reasons why the same choice should be done for both HTML and PDF (see below the differences). And the current status can make either HTML or PDF unreadable or hardly readable. Thus this preference should be split.

Indeed I do not use document fonts for HTML pages because they usually render with a better quality with my own choices. And HTML pages are based on Unicode, so that not using the document fonts won't make a page unreadable. For PDF, this is completely the opposite: special characters (e.g. in math formulas) are specific to the PDF file, so that the font in the PDF MUST be used (I suppose that this is in the PDF spec), otherwise the PDF is unreadable; moreover even with standard characters, if a font is replaced by another one in a PDF, the rendering can be ugly (too large or too small space between some characters) because a part of the layout has already been done (this is not the case with HTML).

Another difference: With PDF, the fonts are necessarily downloaded with the file. With HTML, if some fonts need to be downloaded, you can avoid that, e.g. with slow connections or if you are paying for communication (e.g. via GSM)."

"Bookmarks & History
 ","Rename ""Organize Bookmarks"" menu item","We need to rename the Organize Bookmarks menu item to ""Show all Bookmarks"" to address a usability issue created by the star interface.

Single clicking on the star will produce a small contextual dialog saying ""Page Bookmarked"" but to streamline the interface, it will not say where the bookmark was placed.  Also, so we don't bloat the user's toolbar or menu, we are placing these bookmarks in the ""Unfiled Bookmarks"" folder, which is not accessible through primary UI.  We made these decisions to enable user's to easily bookmark thousands of pages.

However, after seeing the ""Page Bookmarked"" notification many times, user's may eventually wonder ""where are all these bookmarks anyway, I don't see them in my menu or toolbar?""  So for that situation, I think it is important that the bookmarks menu item for displaying the Bookmarks and History window be renamed to reference their confusion.

User: ""Where are all my bookmarks?""
Menu item: ""Show all Bookmarks"""

Summary says it: right-clicking a bookmark in the bookmarks menu is useless, no
options work.

Sorry if this is a duplicate.  It goes along with bug 210910, but nowhere in
that bug report or elsewhere could I find mention of the fact that the context
menu not only causes that bug, but also simply DOES NOT WORK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Bookmarks Menu
2.Navigate to any bookmark.
3.Right click the bookmark, click an option from the context menu.

Actual Results:  
Nothing.  (Or rather, bug 210910, but the point here is that the chose menu item
did not execute.)

Expected Results:  
Execute the option chosen from the context menu.

Bug occurs with default theme.

I consider this a major feature; I would switch from the Mozilla Application
Suite browser (which does not have the context menu feature in the bookmarks
menu at all) to Firebird if this worked properly.  Also, IE has a working
Favorites context menu."

 ",Firefox-Hangs the whole desktop by a unwanted drag near Tabbar,"When using firefox with some tabs and switching between them and closing them (most of the time with a middle click), firefox often enters some drag&drop state and is not leaving it again. While the Cursor shows a drag&drop cursor, i cannot click anywhere inside or outside firefox and the whole desktop is unusable. The keyboard just acts as it normally does.

The only option to stop the ""drag-action"" is to hit ctrl+q to quit firefox. After restarting it the tabs load as always and it at least does not re-enter the drag-state. But it can happen that the same bug occurs soon again.

Steps to reproduce:

I tested the new integrated PDF-Viewer in v19 under Win7/64/Prof with a standard URI of a PDF-Report in a Web-Application. It worked well, as long I did not select the checkbox ""F筌ｍ겈 Dateien dieses Typs immer diese Aktion ausf筌ｍ걳ren"" in the attached screenshot (see Part 1 in BUG_Firefox_v19_PDF-Viewer.pdf).



Actual results:

When I selected this checkbox, i Firefox_v19 created new Tabs in a endless loop until I closed whole Window. See attached screenshot (see Part 2 in BUG_Firefox_v19_PDF-Viewer.pdf).


Expected results:

Firefox should present only one new Tab inlcuding the selected PDF-Report."

Firefox Nightly 68.0a1, Build ID 20190507094727

[Affected Platforms]:

All Windows
All Mac

[Prerequisites]:

Have the System's dark theme enabled.

[Steps to reproduce]:

Start the browser with a new profile and navigate to about:welcome.
Dismiss the modal.
Hover one of the buttons from the first run's cards and observe the behavior.

[Expected results]:

The hover effect is as noticeable as it is on the Default or Light themes.

[Actual results]:

The hover effect is barely noticeable.

[Notes]:

The issue is also reproducible on Linux but given that the System's dark theme is not automatically applied to Firefox, there is a small chance this bug will be encountered on this platform.

Steps to reproduce

In a new profile, make sure browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel to true.

Reset ZIP archive to Always ask. Or
Create a new zip archive (in lowercase) and set the action to open my default zip program, 7-zip.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/2004108 Firefox/0.10

Firefox (branch builds since 20041008
) seems to unregister Internet Explorer as default browser (and does not 
register himself as the new one) although Firefox should not bee the default 
browser.
So after closeing Firefox and starting IE again, IE says it is not the default 
browser anymore (but only if the option to perform this check is active, if not 
it won't tell you that).

This is really annoying because links from chat windows of my IM (trillian) 
won't open correctly anymore - IE opens but shows a blank side with no url in 
the adress bar (just like the blank startpage but without the 'about:blank' as 
url in the adress bar).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.) Start IE and make shure it is set as default browser (check out the option 
in internetsettings -> programs that IE will check on startup if it's the 
default browser or not). If not, than make it the default browser again. 

2.) Close IE and start Firefox (branch build 20041008) and make shure, that the 
option for making FF the default browser is not set. 

3.) Close Firefox and open IE again. You will notice that IE is not the default 
browser anymore although Firefox was not allowed to do so. 

Actual Results:  
- links (from instant messengers or URL files) only opens an empty IE window
- when opening IE and don't making it the default browser again (because the 
option to check if IE is the default browser is not set) you can not open 
internet settings from extras menu in IE

"Address Bar
 ",Finalize visual presentation of identity information (Larry),"There have been several tweaks floating around for Larry presentation, some minor and uncontentious, others less so, and yet there is no bug tracking these discussions.  This bug tracks:

 - Simplify some of the popup text.  This means eliminating or rewording the supplemental text in the SSL case, since it is wordy and confusing right now.

 - Come to a decision on what to do about the url bar display on an SSL site.  On non-SSL we just have the button, on EV we have ""Company Name (Country)"" but on SSL we had the full domain (which was too much repetition) and then bug 402260 hid it completely, but several people (I CC'd those I could remember) are interested to know when it's coming back.  We also need it to not look like another textbox.

 - Address the issue with the winstripe theme (windows/linux) right now introduced by bug 395248.  Dao made Larry much nicer looking in that bug, much more button-ish, instead of just being a textbox, but it had the side effect that instead of turning green as it does on Mac, the Larry box always has the same coloration, and just picks up a blue border highlight on EV.  Whatever we do should be at least marginally consistent, within the constraints of each platform's look and feel.

I've attached a patch that does a first pass at addressing some of these:

 - Identity box text changed to 90%, Bold to set it off from normal text

 - Identity popup on SSL sites drops the supplemental line about ""owner information may not have been verified"" since it is confusing in contrast to the ""Verified"" language above and below.

 - On EV sites, popup is more explicit about Location *and* owner being verified, and includes both in the body text to make it clear that this is a superset of DV verification.

 - Identity box shows eTLD+1 on SSL sites by default. I recognize that this is not strictly what PKI promises (since a sub-sub-sub-domain could obtain a cert which does not give them authority over the top level domain.)  On the other hand, the domain name system, and user expectations as well, assumes that subdomains represent trust delegation, and this feels like a good compromise in terms of telling users *something* about the confirmed identity of the site they are visiting, without gobbling up location-bar real-estate. The patch makes this a tri-state pref (""browser.identity.ssl_domain_display""), with 0 hiding the domain entirely, 1 being eTLD+1, and 2 being full domain (the old Larry behaviour).  In all cases, the info popup includes the full domain.

What's still missing is a solution to the cross-platform disparity in how EV is displayed, but I'd like to get Alex/Beltzner to chime in here from the UX side of things.

Nominating blocking because even if we do none of this, we need a final decision here before ship.  I suppose maybe it could pass as just wanted-firefox3, if we think doing nothing is a reasonable approach.

(For people who want to test the EV display in conjunction with this bug, see bug 404592 comment 2)"

 ",Pocket Reach - Telemetry,"We would like to include some additional telemetry around content recommendations to better allow us to improve the product and resolve bugs faster.

Both content personalization and the decision making process of what stories to show or not to show the user happens client-side within Firefox. This has been a great way for us to put forward a privacy-focus personalization system and is a principle we??耳?committed to. After a few months of this initial implementation in the wild, we????identified some information bottlenecks that are preventing us from iterating quickly on improving the product and also significantly hampering our ability to resolve issues.

One, currently, we have no ability to understand the potential audience size of a particular story without running a guess on the personalization configuration and then tuning it live in the wild. As a result, it means that personalization is very slow to iterate on (as we can only run one of these at a time) and has product risk/potential for bad user experience given that some stories may be shown to more people than expected or less.

Additionally, specific to sponsored stories (spocs), there are a number of reasons why a story may not be shown to a user. However, currently, when a story isn???shown at the volume that we expected, we have no way of diagnosing the problem or understanding where within the numerous logic steps that the client is deciding not to show it. This again makes it hard for us to move quickly to resolve bugs and issues impacting users.

In order to be able to improve personalization and the experience of both organic and sponsored content recommendations, we need to be able to:

1. Test personalization settings without the need to display an article to a user
2. Understand the reason why a sponsored story was or was not shown to a user.

This requires two new pieces of telemetry data.

Note #1: For the purposes of this ticket, a ""personalization configuration"" has two components: (1) a list of domains (and associated weights), and (2) a parameter set (config) that determines how the user???browsing history should be scored in combination with the domain list.

Note #2: For this data to be useful to for analysis, it should use the same pocket-id that is used with the impression/click tracking in place of the client-id.

(1) Personalization Configuration Scores

Every time a new tab is loaded, we would like to log an event with the score for every configuration in the feed response.

Accomplishing this will require some changes to how domain_affinities are passed in the feed response (and thus how activity stream accesses domain affinities to rank content). Pocket will move domain_affinities lists in the /v3/firefox/global-recs response from the spoc objects to the the `settings` of the feed (mapped with a unique identifier):

https://gist.github.com/kennylong/ccb4b09925f31ab21a025c278bdcb5d7

Note: This has the added benefit of reducing the size of the request significantly by reducing the amount of duplicate information returned.

In this example case, the scoring data included for one tab load might be something like:

+--------------------+------------------+-------+
|   parameter_set    |  domain_affinity | score |
+--------------------+------------------+-------+
| default            | business-234     |  0.60 |
| fully-personalized | business-234     |  0.95 |
| default            | sports-235       |  0.60 |
| fully-personalized | sports-235       |  0.00 |
| etc                |                  |       |
+--------------------+------------------+-------+

(2) User Spoc Scoring Logic

In addition to understanding the reach of personalization configurations, we would like to understand where in the sponsored content logic users are getting filtered out. To do that, for each new tab load, we would like to provide an event that indicates why a spoc was shown or not shown on the tab.

The decision process/pre-conditions that have to exist for showing a spoc is as follows:

Does the user have their domain affinities calculated?
Based on the spocsPerNewTab setting: Was the load eligible to see a spoc?
Do any spocs score above their min_score?
Were any of the spocs prevented from being shown due to the frequency cap?
Were any of the spocs not shown because there was another higher scoring spoc available?

If a spoc was not shown, we should be able to understand on each load where within that decision tree it was stopped."

 ","new tabs are moved during the ready event, and should be in the correct location before loading","I'm trying via an addon to control where new tabs open relative to the current active tab. I've thus had a look at the Addon SDK docs, which indicate that by modifying the value of the "".index"" property of a ""Tab"" object, I can control its position in the tab bar. Except, the behaviour is totally inconsistent between opening a new tab by the ""New Tab"" shortcut Ctrl-T, and by Ctrl-clicking on a link.

If I force ""tab.index = 0"" for example (so it should always open as the first tab) :

With Ctrl-T :

Before [tab 1][tab 2][tab 3][tab 4]
After  [NEW TAB][tab 1][tab 2][tab 3][tab 4]
Again  [NEW TAB][tab 5][tab 1][tab 2][tab 3][tab 4]

which is the expected behaviour, the new tab is always at index 0.

But with Ctrl-Click on a link (assuming [tab 1] is the active tab) :

Before [tab 1][tab 2][tab 3][tab 4]
After  [tab 1][tab 2][NEW TAB][tab 3][tab 4]
Again  [tab 1][tab 2][NEW TAB][tab 5][tab 3][tab 4]

Which makes no sense.

And that's with ""tab.index = 0"". With other values such as ""tab.index = 2"" it gets even weirder : Ctrl-T behaviour is logical (the new tab is at index 2 if it can, and opens as last tab otherwise), but Ctrl-Click behaviour is strange (new tabs open to the immediate right of the current tab if current tab index is < 2, otherwise, open as the current tab index + 2...)

* the feedback I provided is that as a Cyrillic user I find it an anti-pattern to use a mixed charset domain regardless of TLD (i.e. the ""Single Script"" level from your doc as far as I understand it regardless of .bg .ru .com .whatever); in original Bug #1332714 I've seen mostly Latin only users concerned that Cyrillic users would be alienated; but I don't think this would be the case (a good approach would be to create a poll about this)
* The arguments against the best solutions I see as a Cyrillic user sound like ""it will not help 100% so solution is useless"". I think that a solution to solve 99% or 95% of the cases is actually quiet an improvement and will make any abuse of the Unicode domains loopholes not worth the effort. Presently certain domains can be happily abused. (about specific way to highlight the mixed charsets there could also be a poll, there are a great deal of possibilities and what I wrote in Bug #1444551 is just for illustration purposes)

At the end I've always believed Mozilla is focused on serving community. If this is the case, then it is counter-productive to remove ability of community to give feedback and state its preference to the kind of solutions to be provided.

Things are non-trivial and a constructive discussion is the way to reach a satisfying outcomes. It is rather hard to drive a large-scale constructive discussion, but I expect Mozilla to be a leader in this area.

Gijs, I appreciate your answer though. Wish you and everybody else all the best.

"Downloads Panel
 ",Avoid using the persisted clusterURL (mainly by not persisting it!),"There are some bugs we are investigating where the user is not ending up on the correct storageURL, even after restarting the browser. Sync expects the value to be stored in preferences, and when it needs the value it reads it from preferences. However, since the move to FxA the cluster URL is obtained from the tokenserver, and this is requested at each startup.

The problem with the current approach is that it is not immediately obvious that Sync is always asking the token server for the cluster URL and it isn't accidentally reusing the clusterURL from a previous run. This makes it difficult to say with certainly that the client is not at fault in the cases where the wrong cluster URL is being used after startup.

So we should just not store it there :) This is another nail in the coffin for the ""legacy identity provider"", but that's OK - it's already dead, just not yet buried.

The only non-obvious thing in this patch is what Weave.js uses this preference as an additional flag to indicate that Sync really is configured. However, this doesn't seem necessary and may even lead to false-negatives - when a user if first signing in to Sync they aren't going to yet have a cluster URL, but Sync is certainly configured at that point. So Weave.js just checks if the username is stored (and as the function in question states, ""It does *not* perform a robust check to see if the client is working"" - it's just a clue that it's probably safe to load Sync-proper and find out more.) Requesting feedback from rnewman on just this part - I'll find someone with more time for the real review (but obviously a real review would be welcome - the patch isn't very big)"

This check will happen regularly (either at a regular interval when we expire the cache, or when we expire the cache via pocket related events that happen on the new tab e.g archiving a saved pocket story)

2. Increase polling time from 1 hour to 1 day so we expire cache and force a server hit once a day rather than once an hour (assuming they are logged in/an active user)

3. Invalidate the cache also if the last time we got new pocket stories (which activity stream got via getHighlights) surpasses the last time a user interacted with pocket (via the pref 'latestSince'). This check will happen on every activity stream SYSTEM_TICK event."

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Events.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 74.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 3, Web Activity.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for pre-release channels only.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :johannh is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 74.

When I go to a web page with the Java plug in, Mozilla Firebird prompts me to
download the plugin. So I press Ok, then I click on ""Java 2 for Linux download""
and then it downloads. When it's finished, the dialog box says: ""installing"" and
then after a few seconds it says ""sucess"". But when I restart the browser and

downloading again but the same thing happened. This worked before but now it
doesn't.

When using the Star icon to add a bookmark or when using the bookmark this page menu item, the UI for adding a bookmark is dismissed/disappears without saving the bookmark.

The line for Folders had 2 drop down boxes.
Clicking on the First (Bold Arrow) brings up the most recent folders (I assume)

I have attached a screen recording of the issue (please keep in mind that there's a 10 minute part in which there is nothing going on): Link.

@nan, could you please take a look at this? I might be wrong, but I think that if we add && usesFirefoxSync == true in the targeting properties we might get the expected result.
For example, if we look at the SAVE_LOGIN message, we use ""isFxAEnabled == true && usesFirefoxSync == false && firefoxVersion >= 70 && firefoxVersion < 72"" and in this case the message is only displayed for users that are not logged in.

 ",FxA based Sync can easily result in data loss,"Hi,

the new FxA based sync can easily result in data loss. I moved a few open tabs to my bookmarks toolbar and didn't notice that I was no more logged in (how would I know that without opening the Australis menu and looking at the bottom of the menu every time I start Firefox? Sometimes I am logged in, sometimes not??. So I entered my password and a few seconds later my last added bookmarks were lost and already deleted bookmarks reappeared. In all the years I had never a data loss issue with Sync. 

In my opinion the user has to be protected against data loss, currently it's too easy to lose important data."

 ",Use referrerpolicy to send Pocket referrer when story has HTTP URL,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1424292 +++

Pocket referrers weren't being sent to http stories because https referrers aren't sent to http domains. This corresponds to a Referrer Policy of ""no-referrer-when-downgrade"", the default.

The fix in bug 1424292 was to change the Pocket referrer to use an http: URL. It works, but doesn't match our policy of encouraging secure links on the web. An alternate fix would be to add a referrerpolicy=""unsafe-url"" attribute to the links so that https:// referrers are sent to http: targets.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-referrerpolicy

(note that appears to be slightly out of date. for the full list of allowed policies see the Referrer Policy spec, but that list contains the one you want anyway.)

Referrerpolicy is also supported on fetch() if that's how you're loading stories. Window.open() doesn't seem to so I filed bug 1433352."

 ",User interface for OSCP-revoked SSL cert is unclear,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20111104165243

Steps to reproduce:

I browsed to https://www.absastockbrokers.co.za/ at the time that they had failed to install their new certificate, and their issuer had REVOKED their current certificate.  


Actual results:

The correct SSL message was displayed , but it was not possible to get any more information.  Since no SSL is established, even in a provisional way, it is not possible to view the certificate, and to see what element of the certificate has been revoked (e.g. the peer certificate, or a signing certificate higher up in the chain).  I was left with shock, horror and disbelief.  I considered creative ways of sorting out the problem - perhaps there is an SSL revocation verifier out there (didn't find one).

Searching the internet found me the following gem of security advice:
 * Turn off OSCP (and how to do it).

Phoning the provider (a bank) provided the following equally amazing gem of security advice:
 * Yes, there is a problem with Firefox, can you try Internet explorer?  (An old enough version will not have OSCP.)

For reference, the somewhat terse message was:
"" https://www.absastockbrokers.co.za
Secure Connection Failed
          An error occurred during a connection to www.absastockbrokers.co.za.
Peer's Certificate has been revoked.
(Error code: sec_error_revoked_certificate)
  The page you are trying to view can not be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
  Please contact the web site owners to inform them of this problem. Alternatively, use the command found in the help menu to report this broken site. ""

Since the site is reported as ""broken"", the possibility of a real genuine security failure is ignored, and users will gladly accept insecure workarounds.


Expected results:

* The authority for the OSCP revocation should be displayed (OSCP is signed by the issuer - so that signature establishes their authority).  
* The time at which the OSCP revocation was received by the browser should be displayed.  (This is a current problem, and has not been resolved.)
* It should be possible to display the invalid certificate chain, with nice red bits around the part that was revoked, and arrows and little UML men that say who revoked it and when we noticed that.  Maybe it can be done without UML men and arrows."

 ","PDF Viewer will run code from PDF files, missing validation for /Domain and /Range parameters","PDF Viewer will convert PostScript calculator functions to JavaScript. While the PostScript code itself is being validated thoroughly, for the Domain and Range parameters in the PDF file the code will only verify that these are arrays (see https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f5ffe4fa2153a798ed8b310a597ea92abd1b868/browser/extensions/pdfjs/content/build/pdf.worker.js#20413). PostScriptCompiler will then insert the array entries into the generated JavaScript code verbatim assuming that these are numbers (as they should be per spec), a malicious PDF file can use strings to inject JavaScript code this way.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+J to open Browser Console.
2. Switch back to the browser and open the attached PDF file.
3. Check the Browser Console.

In Firefox 59.0.2 and 61.0a1 (2018-04-06) nightly the following message shows up in Browser Console: ""Hello, this is code running in resource://pdf.js/build/pdf.worker.js."" You can look at the text of the PDF file to see that the code being executed here is console.log(""Hello, this is code running in "" + location.href).

I did not implement additional exploit steps but code running in the worker can jump over to the viewer itself. For that it would send a malicious glyph to the viewer, you can see under https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f5ffe4fa2153a798ed8b310a597ea92abd1b868/browser/extensions/pdfjs/content/build/pdf.js#6354 that glyph data is being used to produce JavaScript code without further validation - this code assumes that validation happens in the worker.

Once in the viewer, the code could trigger the ChromeActions API available to the viewer (see https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2f5ffe4fa2153a798ed8b310a597ea92abd1b868/browser/extensions/pdfjs/content/PdfStreamConverter.jsm#191) and read/write preferences in the pdfjs.* namespace for example. Also, it could add iframe tags pointing to other PDF files (e.g. from intranet domains). Since PDF Viewer would load into these domains as well, it could access their contents (same-origin) and steal PDF data."

 ","Open in Tab is unusable when menus are not present (tab bar is hidden in popup windows, leads to invisible tabs, esp for external apps, 'search web for...' broken in popup windows)","When menus are not present, you can middle click on a link to open in a new tab,
or you can right-click and select ""Open Link in New Tab"". However, since there
are no menubars, the tab loads into nothingness. It loads, but you can't see it,
and there is no way to get to it (save for Ctrl+Tab).

Steps to Repro:
1. Visit http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/
2. Click on any comments link
3. Open a link in new tab

When someone tries to do this, we should do one of two things:
a) Show the tabs bar so that user can select tabs.
b) Open link in a new window instead.

The current method of loading into nothingness is unacceptable. We can't rely on
users to navigate tabs using only keyboard shortcuts with no visual cues."

 ",Error when a disabled langpack is selected in multilingual UI,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1469688 +++

We ported this functionality to Thunderbird in bug 1487987. While testing the patch for Thunderbird I noticed these issues (from bug 1487987 comment #2):

At first, the alternatives show only en-US, only if you apply a language pack will it appear under alternatives.
Why don't all installed language packs always show up under alternatives. I've chosen DE, FR and en-US as primary languages, one after the other. They now show under alternatives, ES still doesn't show since I never applied it.

[The alternatives windows opens too small after a restart, you can't see the buttons. (I haven't tried that in FF, maybe not an issue.)]

When I restart the session after changing the alternative, I get this in the debug console:

JavaScript error: resource://gre/modules/L10nRegistry.jsm, line 207: TypeError:
L10nRegistry.sources.get(...) is undefined, can't access property ""hasFile"" of it
JavaScript error: , line 0: uncaught exception: undefined

Further from bug 1487987 comment #4:
..., when you disable the language packs they are no more shown in the menulist, but still in the Alternatives dialog. And when you change the language in the dialog and restart, the menulist is empty."

- the download itself is pretty slow. I'm on 100 Mbit but this comes in at 140 KB/sec.
- the server is not providing a content-length or an incorrect content length .. the download manager does not show the actul size and it shows an indeterminate spinner

So it is the browser not the form or Website. The form is crossplatform.

We have a hypothesis that we could speed up the perceived load time of pages if we start preloading pages in the background once we get that intent signal.

This could be particularly valuable, since a behavior that we see in user tests all the time is that users actually type out entire domains, even though it is getting autocompleted. For those users, we could make pages appear to load almost instantly. For users who accept autocomplete results faster, we'd still get a good speed gain in most cases.

We'd probably have to insert some delay before starting the load process, especially when only very few characters have been typed.

This bug is part of a number of efforts to use intent signals in order to kick off processes faster. They are documented here:

Reproducing and debugging the regression:

If you would like to re-run this Talos test on a potential fix, use try with the following syntax:

try: -b o -p win64,linux64,win32 -u none -t g2[Windows 8,Windows XP],tp5o-e10s[Windows 8,Windows XP] --rebuild 5  # add ""mozharness: --spsProfile"" to generate profile data

(we suggest --rebuild 5 to be more confident in the results)

To run the test locally and do a more in-depth investigation, first set up a local Talos environment:

https://wiki.mozilla.lorg/Buildbot/Talos/Running#Running_locally_-_Source_Code

Then run the following command from the directory where you set up Talos:

talos --develop -e [path]/firefox -a tps:tp5o

If we are going to retain that change, then we should simplify the Firefox UI by hiding the domain display in the status bar which I added a couple of release cycles ago. The two bits of UI are near-duplicates of each other (except that the status bar gives the full domain, not the Public Suffix), and we only need one. 

It's quite late in the cycle to rip the code out, and that would be an unnecessary risk, as we can just use a simple CSS rule in the default skin to hide it. (We would need to decide whether to hide the lock also, or whether to keep that.)

"Tabbed Browser
 ",Implement structured bookmark application,"TL;DR: This is the second part of atomic I/O: ""atomic downloads"". 3-way merging of synced bookmarks is impractical on Desktop, and we shouldn't even try to make it work with Places. Two-phase application, where we download then apply, makes sense and gives us some consistency wins.

Richard and I had a really good chat about this; capturing the conversation in a bug so that we can discuss and prioritize.

iOS does proper three-way merges, tracking bookmarks in three tables: ""local"", ""mirror"", and ""buffer"" (the other three tables encode the folder structure). A complete bookmarks tree is produced by overlaying these tables. Updates need to be atomic, and durable in case of an interrupted sync. On iOS, without Sync set up, all bookmarks are inserted into ""local"" (mirror and buffer are empty). On the first sync, remote bookmarks are downloaded and inserted into the buffer, merged (2-way) with local, and inserted into mirror.

After the first sync, local changes are stored in local, and the UI overlays these onto mirror to show the full tree. On the next sync, iOS walks the mirror, diffs between local and buffer (taking one, or resolving conflicts if neededd), and builds a set of ""completion ops"" for changes to the buffer (delete a record because it's been merged), mirror (local or remote deletion, insert merged record, copy from buffer to mirror, and copy from local to mirror), and local (insertion or deletion).

Next, iOS uploads changes. If it's interrupted at this point, buffer, local, and mirror are unchanged; on the next sync, it'll redownload its changes. Then, it clears the buffer, and updates mirror and local. Interruption at this point is OK: local changes either remain in local for the next sync, or were already moved into mirror. Redownloading our own changes is harmless. The completion ops are applied transactionally, so iOS can transition from a valid pre-sync state to a valid post-sync state.

So, that's it for iOS. (Richard, please correct me if my transcription is wrong! I think I missed some of the details). On Desktop, things are messier.

A bookmark sync can touch four Places tables (`moz_bookmarks`, `moz_places`, `moz_items_annos`, and `moz_keywords`, with foreign key references pointing to one another), and the folder structure is encoded in `moz_bookmarks`. Because we apply records as we download them, there's no way to recover from an inconsistent server state: we don't know if a tree is valid until the end of the sync, when we've already mutated our tree. We can only do a two-way merge, because we don't know the shared parent, and, depending on when a sync completes, both local and remote records can change multiple times between syncs.

We can bolt complicated hacks on top of Places: duplicate inserts, updates, and deletes to a Sync-specific table, or copy between Places and the table at the start of a sync, and having our shared parent be the last synced tree. But duplicating bookmark data across two tables and trying to reconcile between them is a world of pain. If these get out of sync (pun intended, and likely if a sync is interrupted), we're back to Sync snarfing your bookmarks. (Even ""last synced tree"" is vague in this world: is it the local tree, pre-sync? Pre-reconciliation? Post-reconciliation?).

We can get partway there with two-phase application: buffer downloaded records in a separate table, then apply them. Grisha is working on adding this to Android in bug 814801. We still can't do three-way merges, but we can avoid partial reads, and add some validation to check for inconsistent trees before applying. We can also show those bookmarks in a read-only UI until we've finished the merge."

That didn't work, but the complex-code is still in place (I tend to complexity of this code is the main reason that it didn't help perf after all)

Experience shows that popups (or maybe just ""heavy"" poupup) may have notable affect on Txul - the startUI-poupp regressed Txul much when it landed. In that case, we fixed the regression by loading editBookmarkOverlay lazily, meaning that the overlay is applied the first time it's needed. This report is on applying this optimization on the edit menu along with the browser's context menu, and on removing the old edit-menu optimization that's mentioned above.

While working this, I noticed that various attributes are set on edit/context-menu items unnecessarily. I'll fix that too"

We must investigate why this happened, cause it may also be useful for future reference, and we should probably understand it before doing further studies.
This indicates a bug in either:

- UITelemetry
- The telemetry collection/analysis
- Interaction of the add-on with something else (another add-on, a specific setting?)

Extract from David Zeber analysis:

""There is a record in Telemetry of whether the searchbar is showing during the subsession. According to that measure, less than half of profiles on the unified branch had the searchbar removed for every subsession during the study. The majority reported the searchbar as being alternatively kept and removed over the course of the study period, and a small percentage of profiles reported the searchbar was kept for every subsession.""

""We expect the Awesomebar to always be in the default position, and the searchbar to be in the expected position for all but a small group who may have modified it manually.

    The Awesomebar is in default position for all but a couple of profiles
    The searchbar is as expected for the control and oneoff branches

3. Firefox will not run; Profile Manager will create new profile, but FF will

Steps to reproduce:
Just open a new tab (set to show 4 rows of shortcuts using Personalizations, although the problem also occurs with any number of rows and regardless of whether or not sponsored shortcuts are enabled). For shortcuts where a stylized letter (e.g. O for onedrive or D for google drive) was shown instead of the favicon, I clicked on the icon to load the website.
Actual results:
Some of the shortcuts (e.g. Amazon, eBay, Gmail, Archlinux, Github, Youtube, Wikipedia) have their correct favicons displayed where they should be (see screenshot). However, others (e.g. Google Docs/Sheets/Forms, OneDrive, Zoom, Void Linux, Oh My ZSH) had just the placeholder letter rather than a favicon showing up (also visible in screenshot). The correct favicon showed up on the tab of the website when it was opened, but when I open another New Tab there still is no favicon loaded.
Expected results:
All of the shortcuts should have the correct favicons displayed. If the favicon for a website was not stored in cache, upon opening the website and saving that favicon and reopening another New Tab, favicons for that website should have been displayed.

Here is a discussion thread on MozillaZine Forums:
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=1316689#1316689

Here is a manual fix to the bookmarks.html file, that also documents how the
problem is caused:

There is a failure to write the proper ID string to the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
within bookmarks.html

The Bookmarks Toolbar Folder is a special folder in your bookmarks, and should
be given a special ID string that reads:
ID=""NC:SystemBookmarksStaticRoot""

Where the failure is occuring is somewhere in the import and bookmark management
process. Instead of treating the Firefox Bookmarks Toolbar Folder as a special
bookmarks folder, Firefox is insisting on treating it as *both* a plain old
folder *and* as something special. U may *tell* Firefox which Bookmark Folder u
want to be your Toolbar folder, and Firefox *may* treat it as such when u see it
in your browser and your toolbar, HOWEVER, Firefox fails to write a critical
piece of code into the HTML file to support your folder's status as the Toolbar
folder.

When u view a bad bookmarks.html file in a text editor (like BBEdit), you will
quickly see that your Bookmarks Toolbar Folder is coded as follows:

<H3 LAST_MODIFIED=""1110965408"" PERSONAL_TOOLBAR_FOLDER=""true""
ID=""rdf:#$FvPhC3"">Bookmarks Toolbar Folder</H3>

The problem is with the code: ID=""rdf:#$FvPhC3""

Firefox does not want to have a customized ID string for the Bookmarks Toolbar
Folder, rather, it should be assigning a special default ID string to indicate
its special status. The code should instead read:

<H3 LAST_MODIFIED=""1110965408"" PERSONAL_TOOLBAR_FOLDER=""true""
ID=""NC:SystemBookmarksStaticRoot"">Bookmarks Toolbar Folder</H3>

The string < ID=""NC:SystemBookmarksStaticRoot"" > helps Firefox to understand
that ""hey, this is special"" and it is not a regular Bookmarks Folder. The
breakdown is that Firefox is assigning special Bookmark Toolbar Folder status as
the user requests, and the app and the browser give that folder all of the
special priviledges of being a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, but Firefox is not
updating the ID to support this special status.

So, when the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder does not get assigned its special ID, the
bookmark search process crashes the application.

I have been able to consistantly reproduce this using my own bookmark files, and
other users have done the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox and import MSIE bookmarks.

2. Move MSIE bookmarks to a ""newly created"" Bookmark Toolbar Folder. The folder
will not rename its ID to ""NC:SystemBookmarksStaticRoot"" as it should when u are
importing bookmarks from IE.

3. Do any bookmark search, whether in a sidebar or a separate bookmark window --
it will always crash.

Actual Results:  
The browser crashes 100% of the time.

Expected Results:  
It should have given you the search results of the bookmarks."
"Sync
 ","Allow secure storage of Sync/Firefox Account credentials if ""save passwords"" and/or master password are disabled","As a fairly strong rule, we don't want to offer a login UI on each startup.  Frequency of password entry is inversely tied to password strength, and it's worse if there's multiple passwords, so a login UI will lead to users using weaker passwords, in general.  If users are not using password manager for web pages, but want to use Weave, we should special case these users as follows:

* Tell them explicitly that we will store the passwords in the password manager
* Make them opt _out_ of using a master password (or possibly force them to use the master password)

If their MP is weak, but the password/passphrase remain strong, that's less bad, because that's just protecting against local attacks, and there's other mitigations for that, but weak passphrase/password exposes users _far_ worse, and we shouldn't create UI that will move users in that direction."

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Events.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Fx75.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :ewright is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Fx75.

 ",Make the initial tab remote immediately instead of initially making it non-remote,"We should do this because it avoids creating and then immediately re-creating a browser, and all its frame scripts etc., so it makes window opening faster.

There's a few issues with doing this right now. This trypush ( https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=306f577a29c017f5352497b82e6bd0054fc616df&selectedJob=201442995 ) is a bit old, but the fundamental issue seems to be that we have a bunch of tests that call `window.open` in the parent process, which ends us up with an opener in the parent. Prior to fixing this bug we then make the content frame remote after initially making it non-remote (which created the initial frame loader which gets the opener ref). After the patch, we make the content frame remote immediately, which gets the opener ref but is also remote, which trips this assertion: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/06d5d5ae4396be85f26e8548323ee6c12e7bce4e/dom/base/nsFrameLoader.cpp#187-188

We can just fix most of these tests. I don't think this can currently be hit by users and/or websites - it's only our own random code that manually calls window.open in a chrome context without  . Alternatively, we could potentially null out the opener in this case instead of asserting, but given the tests seem to just be wrong, my gut sense is to fix the tests."

 ",Determine why Google Meet asks Firefox for the microphone and camera separately when joining a call,"STR:

Ensure you are logged into a Google account.
In Firefox, visit https://meet.new to create a new Google Meet call

ER:
Google Meet should ask for the microphone and camera devices simultaneously like it does in Chromium browsers and Safari.
AR:
Google Meet first asks for the microphone permission. After it has received a response, it then asks for the camera permission.
Interestingly, if I set my UA string to:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0
Google Meet will happily ask for both devices. This might be a question of reaching out to the Google Meet developers and have them ask for both devices simultaneously.

Hold the Enter Key for 3 seconds and this will the entire files from that folder.

Expected results:
This is not reproducible in Mozilla Windows, only Mac Firefox versions are vulnerable because in Mozilla Windows the Final Upload button was by default set to ""Cancel"" button(As per the old fixes) so even is user keep pressing ""Enter"" key for long time, at the final stage the Upload will get cancel because it is auto focused.
This is not happening in Mozilla Mac Browser, all the Firefox Mac versions keep auto focus on the Upload button, so when user holds the ""Enter"" key the Upload button gets pressed which acts as user consent to upload the entire directory.
This is affecting all the other browser which is using Mozilla Firefox Engine Ex. Tor Browser,

Presently the only way to undo that is to remove their browsing history for that site, we should offer a better way.

Since this is a permission, of sorts (ie: permitting the website to know where you are) I think it's best that we add it to the Page Info > Permissions, though Doug makes a case for it being in the Security Tab along with Cookies and Passwords. I think the former is easier, requiring a single string:

Share Location
            ( ) Always Ask ( ) Allow ( ) Block

this control would be set to Block and disabled when geo.enabled is set to false.

For the Security Tab, we'd need:

Can this website see my location?   Always / Never / If you let it (?)

and a button to clear.

My feeling is that this is actually a permission (what is the website allowed to do) which allows the website to do something that has a privacy implication. I prefer the former solution."

However, I found out that the multiple reflows can be easily avoided by temporarily removing the richlixtbox from the document. This isn't noticeable at at all, and at least on my machine it almost completely resolves the slowness we see on Alice's profile. So, ugly as it is, I think we should go ahead and do it.

I also found out that ""un-attaching"" the richlistitem binding from the inactive elements has a notable positive effect. This hack I like less, because it could have some side-effects (for example, it'd be a little tricky to have searchLabel working for this items). However, the gain is notable enough that it's at least worth trying. We can take it back later if it turns out to be problematic.

3.b. A dropdown also appears with other suggestions
4. After having clicked on the bar, the mouse may have 'accidently slid down' a little, to one of the dropdown suggestions. I don't care, because I don't want the suggestions. I press return. 

1. Click on the search bar
2. Type 'Goog'
3. While typing, suggestions will appear in the dropdown. I don't care about them, because I want to type something new. My mouse may slide down to one of the suggestions though, after I've clicked in the bar.
4. I decide I want to search for something else, so I select what I wrote (shift-control-arrow left) and press delete, so that I can type something else. 


Actual results:

The mouse-hovered item is affected, rather than the typed one.

- In the case of the url bar, [return] navigates to the hover-over item instead of what's in the url bar. 
- In the case of the search bar, [delete] deletes the hovered-over search suggestion instead of the word I typed and selected.


Expected results:

When I press a keyboard key such as return or delete, I expect it to have an effect on the area I'm typing in, not on what I'm mouse-hovering on. The current behavior is mixing two different input options, which is very confusing. 

If I want to mouse-select, I'll mouse-hover and mouse-click. If I want to keyboard-select, I'll keyboard-arrow-down and keyboard-return. If I want to delete, I'll keyboard-arrow-down and keyboard-(shift-)delete. 

Whatever the case, I don't expect what I'm hovering over to be ""selected"". I'm only ""hovering""..... 

This may be related to Bug 1176107 and/or Bug 1283398.


[NOTE]
I experience the same issue in Thunderbird, it actually has even worse implications there. I may type ""Ma"" in the To: field and see that ""Maarten"" is pre-filled, which is great because he's who I want. My mouse may have slid down to another option starting with ""Ma"" though, but it wouldn't cross my mind that when I now click in the body of my email, or press ""Send"", that it will secretly change the To-field and send my email to who I was hovering over rather than to who actually appeared as typed-in! 

This behavior did not occur a year ago (maybe a little more), so a relatively recent change caused hovered-over items to be considered to be 'selected'."

 ",FInd functionality recursion exceeds javascript stack size limitations for large pdf files,"Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached pdf (2001SimplePages.pdf) using the FF pdf viewer, which is a large number of pages text-only pdf file that only has page numbers for each page. (Note this bug can be duplicated using many pdfs found in the wild, but they are enormous in size, one is the house affordable health care act at  http://housedocs.house.gov/rules/health/111_ahcaa.pdf, and Intel makes such large pdf files for various processor manuals. Interestingly, with just page numbers and only text this is a very large pdf, although much smaller than it would be with content.)
2. In the find box enter the number string ""2000"".
3. Wait until the page number 2000 is found and highlighted (can take awhile). 
4. Press the next button (down caret).

What happens:
The find functionality hangs at step 4 showing the swirling busy gif image continuously.

What should happen:
The message that the find wrapped around to the beginning of the file should appear and the same page ""2000"" should be highlighted. The busy indicator should halt almost immediately.


Further Information:
The following console message occurred (using a version of pdf.js used in one of the FF 25 beta builds)
************************************************************
* Call to xpconnect wrapped JSObject produced this error:  *
[Exception... ""'[JavaScript Error: ""too much recursion"" {file: ""resource://pdf.j
s/web/viewer.js"" line: 871}]' when calling method: [nsIDOMEventListener::handleE

ation: ""native frame :: <unknown filename> :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 0""  data: yes]

************************************************************

This console error output identifies the function nextPageMatch (at line 871 in that version) which reads:
    matchesReady(pageMatches[pageIdx]);
The matchesReady function is a local function of nextPageMatch, that in some circumstances calls its parent function nextPageMatch where it reads:
        this.nextPageMatch();.
While this two-step recursion can only build a stack with two frames for each page of the document, since pdf documents have an unbounded number of pages this can result in an unbounded linear (multiple of two js stack frames per page) stack size and the result is that the recursion is halted by the runtime for such a large pdf and unique find string??딆였rowing an exception. This exception causes a js promise for the find functionality to fail silently, and then the find functionality sits indefinitely in a pending state. While the bugs are distinct and the fixes do not overlap in the code, this bug can appear to be the same or similar to Bug 916876. It is not clear to me whether Bug 916876 has been fixed already by recent work identified in a pdf.js irc conversation, I will figure that out after this bug has been processed. For this bug I already have working code (distinct from my possibly unneeded fix for Bug 916876) that unravels the unbounded recursion into an iteration, and I will isolate just that fix into a pull request shortly. BTW, the iterative implementation executes considerably faster."

I had just finished closing out of Firefox after switching to the default theme
in the theme menu.  After having closed out for a few minutes I reopened Firefox
to search on google, however I was unable to open Firefox due to the fact that
it thought the default profile was still in use, after cancelling and reopening
the same error appeared.  After coming to the conclusion that I didn't need my
normal profile to just finish a quick search on Google I created another profile
with the title ""Default User"".  Sadly I can not find a way to switch back to the
original profile with the simple title ""default"".  I now have lost all bookmarks
and such unless I can switch back to the previous profile, some of those
contained business links which I'm unable to easily find due to the complex
searches involved to find them in the first place.  I know that this may sound
like a whinny little jerk, who blaims you for some stupid choice, but I could
really use your help.  I then tried to search your online forum, where the
search feature was disabled, I checked with your support webpage, in which the
directions failed to bring up the profile manager.  That's all that's really
needed, is some way to find the profile manager, and get back to my ""default""
profile.  Sadly I haven't been able to find a way on my own.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened the Run menu ran ""Firefox.exe -P"" and recieved an error message saying
no such file exists
2. Attempted to search the online help forum, where the search option was disabled.
3. Went through almost every level of menu items to find the profile manager,
and failed to locate it.

Actual Results:  
Failed to be able to switch back to ""default"" profile

Expected Results:  
Hopefully start to use the ""default"" profile where over a years worth of
business links have been saved.

If you sign up for this site (free) and log into this page, you will get a small picture with white pixels on a black background. When the page loads a timer counts down to a javascript alert after 15 seconds. If you attempt to drag that (or any) picture when the alert finally pops up, it will crash the browser. You can still see the pages on the screen, but no buttons or menus can be accessed and it must be killed in Task Manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into the above site and navigate to that URL
2. On page load, drag picture with white pixels on black bkgd around for at least 15 seconds.
3. Once javascript alert fires, browser will stop functioning.
Actual Results:  
Drag stopped in mid-drag, alert stayed on screen but was unable to be accessed. No other menus or buttons could be accessed until FF was stopped and restarted.

Expected Results:  
Since javascript alerts take active control until you close them, I would assume that the drag would need to be cancelled altogether and then restarted after the alert has been satisfied.

"Migration
 ",PlacesController efficiency improvements,"As mentioned on the best place to report your bugs (/msg sspitzer), the patch on bug 359462 is supposed to slow us down a bit esp. once places-based bookmarks is enabled for two reasons:
 1. All supported commands are updated for each focus/select event.
 2. _selectionOverlapsSystemArea and _canInsert are called for each coomand, no caching is done.

Together, these are a real hit in the browser window, and is esp. wrong since it has no focusable views. My plan is to fix the events issue by updating places-specific commands on a places-specific event (someting like window.updateCommands(""PlacesCommands"")). We'll still go through the PlacesController(s) for focus/select events, I don't consider this an issue since the enableEditCommands property of each view is checked by its PlacesController before any further check is done.

I'm not yet sure what to do with the second issue here, it might not worth the necessary code complexity once the events issue is addressed."

While it doesn't violate the Apple HIG, cmd-d is usually used for other things
in OS X. Delete is commonly used to delete items from lists (such as the
bookmarks manager in Safari, or mails in Mail), so it fits this use.
Furthermore, cmd-d is used to *add* a bookmark in the main browser window, so it
doesn't make sense for it to do the opposite in the bookmarks manager.

"WebPayments UI
 ",tabs collection may exceed memcached server limits,"[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

In bug 1393659 we changed how we calculate how many tabs can fit in a payload to use data returned from info/configuration. However, in bug 1300451 comment 40 and later, we see that the ""tabs"" collection is stored in memcached so in-practice can not use the advertised server limits.

Therefore we should change http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f6dc0e40b51a37c34e1683865395e72e7fca592c/services/sync/modules/engines/tabs.js#221 to use a hard-coded limit.

Ryan, is 1MB an appropriate limit? Seeing we had 256k before and no complaints, I'd be fine with 512kb or even all the way back to 256k if there was a reason to do so."
"WebPayments UI
 ",The FxA signin form on about:welcome discards metrics query params,"The new about:welcome page contains a signin form that submits to Firefox Accounts:

This form declares some metrics query parameters in the <form> action attribute, and some more parameters as <input> elements in the form body, like so:

    <form method=""get"" action=""https://accounts.firefox.com?entrypoint=activity-stream-firstrun&utm_source=activity-stream&utm_campaign=firstrun"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" onSubmit={this.onSubmit}>
        <input name=""service"" type=""hidden"" value=""sync"" />

        <input name=""context"" type=""hidden"" value=""fx_desktop_v3"" />
        <input name=""email"" type=""email"" required=""true""/>
    </form>

Unfortunately, forms do not support splitting up query parameters like this.  When the form is submitted, the query string from the ""action"" attribute is discarded and values from the <input> elements are appended, as described here:

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1116019/submitting-a-get-form-with-query-string-params-and-hidden-params-disappear

So result is that metrics params like entrypoint=activity-stream-firstrun are not passed through to FxA, and we will not be able to provide metrics on the performance of this form.

I recommend moving all the query parameters into additional <input type=""hidden""> fields in the form body."

Intermittently, very frequently visited pages have disappeared from my location bar autocomplete list.  For instance, ""http://slashdot.org/"" will not appear in the list, even though it is usually the first result as soon as an ""s"" is typed.  As more of the URL is typed, it still does not appear, although various subpages start to show up.  Manually typing in the full URL and re-visiting the page seems to restore it to its proper place in the auto-complete results, at least until this bug reoccurs.

I have not been able to determine what triggers this; I have only seen it on very frequently visited sites that should be the first autocomplete results, although its possible that I simply haven't noticed it occurring to less visited sites.  I have seen this happen to a group of frequently visited sites all around the same time, but I have also seen it happen to just one, leaving the others unaffected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal usage of the browser.
2. Start typing a URL into the location bar.
Actual Results:

Bug 646085: 4.0. Just history.

Crossing platforms and Firefox versions. In all cases, the client has the key that's on the server. In some cases the server key timestamp has changed, which implies that the other client is also attempting HMAC-failure recovery (to no avail).

The logs show that the downloaded keys are the same as the locally stored keys... and yet they cannot decrypt the records on the server.

The obvious implication is that one client at some point is generating records using a corrupt key. It never has to read them again, so the other devices are the ones to throw the errors.

 ",Experiment with lowering frame rate on low-end devices,"We're investigating lowering frame rate on low-end devices as a way to improve (perceived) performance.

Just setting the layout.frame_rate pref to 30, and running the raptor tp6 page load tests on the 2018 perf reference device, I'm seeing 10% improvements across the board on load times compared with the default (-1) setting.

Trying to write a proof-of-concept patch, I've run into 2 issues:

1) trying to avoid front-loading the cost of invoking sysinfo ( x-ref bug 1363586 ), and making it easy to test this configuration, I thought it'd make sense to have the gfx sanity test set a pref, which I'd key off to halve the result of https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/fc3d974254660b34638b2af9d5431618b191b233/gfx/thebes/gfxPlatform.cpp#3060 . Unfortunately, it seems that if I add this as a `Once` pref (which is how the frame_rate pref is configured) in gfxPrefs, the result is that we read the default value of the pref, rather than the user-set value, thus meaning the pref isn't honoured. I'm not sure what the best way to address this would be, and I'd appreciate pointers to the right point in gfx startup to add a conditional for this.

2) doing this will cause web-observable side-effects in animations, games, and maybe other things (video? apz/scrolling?). I noticed, as a somewhat bizarre example, that when trying to verify the frame rate was successfully adjusted and using https://www.testufo.com/ (search engine hit for 'frame rate test') that the page thinks the frame rate is so low that ""something is wrong"" (""Low Framerate. Try closing all apps and browser tabs.""). So I'm wondering if that's something we're comfortable with, or if we'll need to do this in a more complicated way, where use of video or requestAnimationFrame or whatever ""ups"" the framerate for that tab (while it's active/selected).

Bas, are these points something you can help with?"

This makes it painful to add a new kind of perf test and cover all the existing interactions we care about, and also makes it painful to add a new interaction to cover, as that requires creating new test files for each relevant kind of test, which involves a lot of copy/pasting despite the already shared helper code in head.js

I'm proposing that instead we make test files only contain the code triggering the interactions and the whitelists, and move everything else to head.js."

"Extension Compatibility
 ",[e10s] Add-on multiprocess compatible shims stops TabSelect event listeners being removed from the tab container,"In Hello, we're listening to TabSelect events when we're doing browser tab sharing. We noticed bug 1264334, which caused more investigation.

When we start browser sharing we essentially do:

window.gBrowser.tabContainer.addEventListener(""TabSelect"", this);

When we stop it we do:

window.gBrowser.tabContainer.removeEventListener(""TabSelect"", this);

However, we're seeing in both non-e10s and e10s modes, that the TabSelect event still fires after it has been removed.

If we declare Hello as e10s compatible, via install.rdf (which we can't do at the moment due to bug 1262560):

<em:multiprocessCompatible>true</em:multiprocessCompatible>

then the TabSelect listeners get removed correctly, and everything works as we expect.

I'm therefore assuming this issue is in the shim code, since that's the only change I'm making here.

This is also potentially bad for existing add-ons as it happens in non-e10s mode.

I've reproduced on FF 47 & 48. I've not tried 45 or 46 since we're not really compatible there."

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Histograms.json](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Histograms.json) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 84.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 1, Technical.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :bdahl is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 84.

This does not respond to normal manipulations in browser.css, so that the only image that can be used is an image that is located in the browser/places directory, and has the name of livemarkItem.png. 

It is not amenable to a -moz-image-region call, so that a themer cannot assign a differing image for :hover or [open=""true""] pseudo-classes. 

Although the default theme has code which attempts to assign the icon to chrome://browser/skin/livemark-folder.png, even using an !important tag, and tries to assign a differing image region for the open pseudo-class, nothing happens.

** Use case: guess that you want to clear about two hours, see that this looks right (or drag the range a little, since it was really more like two hours and 15 min), and then click clear.
* Goal: provide more warning before the user clears all of their history
** Use case: user selects ""everything"" by accident, and they subsequently realize that they don't want to nuke all the history in their profile thanks to the warning interface we have designed.

= Non Goals =
* The largest non-goal is to directly cater to the needs of users who expect the dialog to behave in the same way as the previous version.  For instance, if the user regularly opens this dialog to clear all of your active logins, this now a more complex operation since they need to now expand the details are, and also scroll down to get to active log-ins.
* Another non-goal is for this dialog to enable a full reset of Firefox (including personal data level things like passwords, bookmarks, new dictionary entries, add-ons and and setting).  A total Firefox reset is best handled with some type of higher level profile manager UI, and probably not from inside of the application itself.

In a live bookmark folder, when an entry of the RSS has no <link> (which is
permitted by the spec), Firefox should use the (mandatory) <link> at root level.

This would allow for a ""default target"" in RSS, which is especially useful when
several news are related to the same page (but not all, since bookmarks wouldn't
be meaningful then). For example, when a RSS feed lists all changes to a site,
some news refer to a specific page, but several aren't bound to a specific
location, and thus are to be linked with the home page.

Currently, entries lacking a <link> aren't displayed, and if none has a <link>
the message ""the feed failed to load"" is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Add ""http://www.komite.net/pl/hidden/avec.rss"" and
""http://www.komite.net/pl/hidden/sans.rss"" to the live bookmarks.

The second has those same five entries, but two of them lacking their <link>.

from fischer's comment
```
Please switch the usage between userTours and onboardingTours. That is, let userTours be the tours map and let onboardingTours still be the tours array as originally. This is for backward compatibilty, because we have other codes which is using onboardingTours. This code compatibility handling is a bit tricky, maybe we could handle when rebasing code and have a discussion about how to approach then.

And because the tour notification would need the tours to prompt notification, we need to decide tours in the init stage or the tour notification couldn't find any tours to prompt.

This issue applies to a page with multiple textfields (all with different
autocomplete data in each text field.  If the user uses autocomplete on one
textfield and then moves to another text field and presses the down arrow, the
autocomplete options presented are wrong.  Instead autocomplete presents
whatever the last selection option from the other textfield.

2. Fill in some data in the text fields and hit the ""conect"" button
3. Go back to the same page again.
4. Select and use an autocomplete option on the first text field (any method is
ok, whether it be keyboard or mouse).  In other words, fill in that text field
using autocomplete.
5. Place the cursor in another blank text field.
6. Press the down arrow key.

Actual Results:  
You will notice that the option that autocomplete gives you is the same data as
what you filled in in the previous text field.
You can repeat this process on other textfields and it will show the same data.

I opened the menu (icon with the three lines far to the right) and clicked on ""Preferences"" as I expected to change this behaviour
Nothing happens. No preferences pages opened.
I opened another tab (which was 100% pure blank as well in contrast of what to expect)
I again tried to open preferences. This time (!) it worked.
Preferences showed: ""Firefox Home"" is selected if I open new tabs. Though if I open new tabs I don't get ""Firefox Home"" but a blank page.

 ",New Tab Page Drag&Drop Causes Overlapping Tiles,"With the introduction of scrollbars in about:newtab, we can easily reproduce a bunch of inconsistent behaviour while dragging and dropping tiles.

The first problem is that the page does not 'hot scroll', which is a typical behaviour when dragging off/near a scrollable boundary.  The expected behaviour would be that scrolling would automatically be activated when a tile is dragged close to the edge of a scrollable region.  That is, a tile dragged to the bottom of the window should cause the window's contents to 'scroll up'.

When a tile is dropped onto a partially visible tile on the bottom of the screen, it causes inconsistent overlapping of tiles, where one tile sits on top of another.  Resizing the window while in this state causes the obscured tile (and the search text entry box) to move incorrectly.  In addition, there is a 'hole' in the tileset where (one would presume) the obscured tile is *supposed* to be.

Also, once the newtab is in this state, drag & drop does not work anymore.

Data Collection Review

1) Is there or will there be **documentation** that describes the schema for the ultimate data set in a public, complete, and accurate way?

Yes, documentation will either be linked from https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/datasets/dynamic_telemetry.html, or the event definition will be migrated into Events.yaml before landing, and the probe dictionary will provide documentation.

2) Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes, the Firefox telemetry opt-out.

3) If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

n/a

4) Using the **[category system of data types](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection)** on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

The collection reports URLs but they are chosen from a list in browser/components/doh/TRRPerformance.jsm and reflect technical measurements and not user activity, so these are Category 1, technical data.

5) Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default-on.

6) Does the instrumentation include the addition of **any *new* identifiers**?

No.

7) Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice? 

Yes.

8) Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Nihanth is response for renewing the collection as required.

9) Does the data collection use a third-party collection tool?

No."

 ",Determine impact of stub installer default browser checkbox,"Before we completely remove this checkbox (bug 1272162), I'd like to have a clearer understanding of its direct impact. Usually, the way to measure this kind of thing would be to do an A/B test (eg Funnelcake), and compare the test to a control group. Changes to the stub installer require a full-up build and release, so a Funnelcake repack isn't possible here. Instead, we'd like to do the following, which is basically doing an A/B test in a normal release:

1) The stub installer will hide the checkbox for a small, randomly chosen test cohort. EG:  if(random() < 0.01) { hidden = true; }

2) When the stub installer does this, it will tag the install as part of the test cohort. Probably with a registry key, similar to what was done in bug 1041514.

3) Firefox will record that registry key in opt-out telemetry.

After this hits Release and soaks for a while, we'll run a telemetry analysis to compare user retention, usage hours, etc for the two cohorts. (IE, Win 7/XP users who got the checkbox as normal vs those who didn't as part of this test.)

If there's no significant difference, we should proceed with bug 1272162. If there's a small difference, we should discuss if the qualitative benefits mean we should should still proceed with bug 1272162. This will give us the clearest understanding of the specific impact of what we're doing, and enable us to make an informed decision on deliberate change.

[Verdi suggested we could arrange for a heartbeat survey to see if users who didn't get the checkbox are happier as a result, which would help build the case for such qualitative benefits; good idea, separate bug.]

This is a minimal change to the stub installer, and since Jared's already done similar work in bug 1041514 he'll pick this up."

This might not actually be the Firefox Sync issue... maybe it's just the nightly build doing something odd?

Here's the raw entry...

javascript:var s='%s'; url='https://jira.blah.blah.com/secure/QuickSearch.jspa?searchString='; t=''; qc=0; chunks=url.split('%s'); for(i=0; i<s.length; i++){if(s.charAt(i)=='\""')qc=qc^1; t+=((s.charAt(i)==' '&&qc)?'^':s.charAt(i)); }args=t.split(/\s/); nurl=''; for(i=0; i<chunks.length; i++){nurl+=chunks[i]; if(args[i]!=undefined) {args[i]=args[i].replace(/\^/g,' '); nurl+=args[i]; }}location.replace(nurl,'< BR>');

But then, once the bookmark seems to be saved, it ends up urlencoded and then it does not seem to work...

javascript:var%20s='%s';%20url='https://jira.blah.blah.com/secure/QuickSearch.jspa?searchString=%27;%20t=%27%27;%20qc=0;%20chunks=url.split(%27%s%27);%20for(i=0;%20i%3Cs.length;%20i++){if(s.charAt(i)==%27\%22%27)qc=qc^1;%20t+=((s.charAt(i)==%27%20%27&&qc)?%27^%27:s.charAt(i));%20}args=t.split(/\s/);%20nurl=%27%27;%20for(i=0;%20i%3Cchunks.length;%20i++){nurl+=chunks[i];%20if(args[i]!=undefined)%20{args[i]=args[i].replace(/\^/g,%27%20%27);%20nurl+=args[i];%20}}location.replace(nurl,%27%3C%20BR%3E%27);


Actual results:

Typed associated 'keyword' into awesome bar with appropriate text for the search to the service associated with the bookmarklet - hit return. Awesome bar showed the url-encoded javascript and then failed to submit anything, nothing happened. No request made.


Expected results:

Typed associated 'keyword' into awesome bar with appropriate text for the search to the service associated with the bookmarklet - hit return. Awesome bar should show something and request is made as per the javascript 'location.replace'."

I have four clients, but I'm only syncing every hour. That implies that we're hitting the idle logic, not the active logic. This is happening even when I trigger an instant sync by bookmarking an item, so I'm definitely not idle. Something is screwing up in monitoring of idle state, perhaps.

Further, my last sync last night set my next sync interval to one hour later, but it didn't sync again until I manually told it to, 15 hours later:

so apparently that half of instant sync isn't working -- I picked the machine up and did my usual browsing for more than five minutes, ultimately creating a new window and hitting ""Sync Now"" to pick up tabs I'd sent to this machine 12 hours previously.

In the Cookie Manager (Tools->Options...->Privacy->Cookies->Stored Cookies...),
when selecting (with the Ctrl+Click key combo.) and deleting a non-contiguous
(not next to each other) series of cookies, the Cookie Manager leaves the
remaining cookies chosen with the Ctrl+click in the UI position they were in

intervening cookies).

Steps to Reproduce:
Assuming multiple cookies have been set in the browser.
1.Click on Tools->Options...->Privacy->Cookies->Stored Cookies...
2.Select two or more, non-contiguous cookies.
3.Click 'Remove Cookie'.

Actual Results:  
The first cookie is deleted and the list of cookies is reformatted to close the
space created.  The second (and subsequent) cookies chosen (by means of the
Ctrl+click method) are also deleted (as far as I can tell), but the Cookie
Manager UI-listing of the spaces created by the deleted cookie are not closed
(i.e. follow-on cookies are not moved to fill the spaces).

Expected Results:  
Cookies selected by means of the Ctrl+click, non-contiguous selection method
should have their spaces occupied by the remaining cookies (if any) after the
user chooses 'Remove Cookie'."

When you type in the address bar, a suggestion pulldown opens and there is an MSAA POPUPSTART event fired.   When you close the pulldown, the matching MSAA POPUPEND event does not fire on the same HWND.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Accevent; Adjust settings so that all menu events are reported as well as the HWND that fired the event.
2. Go to address bar with ctrl-L
3. Type a few characters so that the suggestions pulldown opens.   Note the HWND on the EVENT_SYSTEM_MENUPOPUPSTART
4. Left arrow or hit F6 to close the suggestions pulldown.
5. Note the HWND that fires the EVENT_SYSTEM_MENUPOPUPEND.  The two HWNDs should be the same
Actual Results:  
The opening HWND is a ""MozillaDropShadowWindowClass"" classed window that is a child of the desktop.
The closing HWND is a ""MozillaWindowClass"" classed window that is an immediate child of the main Firefox UI window.

Both events would be fired on the ""MozillaDropShadowWindowClass"" window.

each image in parallel.

Expected Results:  
Browser should never never never freeze while downloading, because it prevents
the user to do another activities like browsing another page in another tab
while the other downloads.

I think it is possible to handle the downloads and refreshing the tabs using
threads that doesn't affect browser behaviour at the user interface level.

For example, Internet Explorer doesn't show this behaviour with the same pages.

I will post an example page as soon as I can.

I use extensions.checkCompatibility.nightly=false and extensions.allow-non-mpc-extensions=true and updated to FF55.0a1, 64bit, Build 2017-05-15 today.
After that I get a popup on restart from browser.xul.
Restarted in Save Mode to deactivate incompatible add-ons.
After that I got a lot of tabs in Save Mode asking me to ""Allow this installation"" of each Add-on. Guess this is the first bug because Save Mode shouldn't ""reinstall"" all the add-ons.
I allowed all and that seems was the mistake.
After that I had a look into about:addons. Seems there is a second bug, because the user can't see which add-ons are enabled by normal booting and can't disable them.
After restart in normal mode I had marked all add-ons as disabled but a lot be now enabled.
Tried to enable and disable them again, but doesn't work.
Enabled add-ons are e.g. the Google Toolbar and the S3 Download-Toolbar.
Toolbars can't be disabled via the Menu Bar to be not shown.
After restart in Safe Mode again, I have the add-ons still enabled.
Seems FF messed a lot up. Searching now for a config e.g. in about:config to disable the add-ons now again. Any help will be welcome because I don't want to reset my profile."

I am using 0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9, 1 as the zoom out settings and that seems to give me all the zooms I need for my pages.

I'm classing this as a regression since text zoom gave better control than page zoom does currently.

 ","'not secure' message shown on ""secure"" HTTPS popup login page","Visiting the login page for my local grocery store's delivery site, Firefox showed a scary 'not secure' message in the little dropdown that appears when attempting to invoke password autocomplete (this is very unnerving and weird, also - see bug 1329188)

Naturally, I saw the message and tried to figure out what was up. The address bar showed a green lock (secure?) and the url was https. However, clicking the green lock showed a little message suggesting the page was insecure... with no explanation.

I never found any explanation for why Firefox was saying the secure page was also insecure. When I revisited a few minutes later, no security warnings appeared.

Temporary OCSP failure? I don't really know what happened here, but in my opinion it's DEFINITELY a bad thing that Firefox will call a page both secure and insecure at the same time. It worries me that I could be seeing the green lock on pages that are actually hijacked or compromised."

 ","Clients engine doesn't handle duplicate commands correctly, causing multiple events to be ""sent"" but only one ""received""","STR:
* On one device, send the same tab to the same device multiple times. Restart, check about:telemetry, notice there are multiple events, each with different flow IDs written for these sends.

* Start the target device, sync. Notice the incoming tab is only opened once. Restart, check about:telemetry, notice that only 1 event for the receive is recorded.

This will cause our telemetry to report a poor success rate - we have multiple sends but only 1 receive.

What's happening is:

* We expect http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/66d9eb3103e429127c85a7921e16c5a02458a127/services/sync/modules/engines/clients.js#576 to notice the duplicate - however, that fails to work because the commands have already been synced - so we go ahead and write a new event.

* However, the duplicates *are* discarded at http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/66d9eb3103e429127c85a7921e16c5a02458a127/services/sync/modules/engines/clients.js#873 - but at this time we have already written the ""event"" to the sync ping.

1) The history of selected tabs should be restored first. We'll send messages to the docShells of all tabs we restore and so the more important and visible ones can react first and start loading their pages.

2) We send a message to restore the history and only after that is done the parent receives a message and sets tab label and icon. We need to do this afterwards because restoring the history resets label and icon. We however should also do this before sending the ""restore history"" message, that helps improving the whole UX a lot with my session as the response can take ~1s even on my machine."

In firefox 3.0, i could drag a tab onto a explorer window or my desktop, to make a shortcut to it.

Since firefox 3.1, this result in a new browser window, as tear of tab kicks in.
Now this is about the one and only sensible use case where tear of tab should kick in, but the old behaviour is still lost.

It would make sense it it was possible to make a shortcut by selecting the address bar, and drag the url onto the desktop. (google chrome works like this).

Looking in comm-central, it looks like the error message is in 3 places, currently :

 ",Make tab line color fallback to the selected tab text color instead of accentcolor,"See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1506913#c4

Right now, the tab line color falls back to the accentcolor on themes. This is problematic because themes with a background image will use accentcolor instead of setting the tab_line property. Setting accentcolor has more consequences than just changing the tab line color, but unfortunately, for themes with background images, those consequences are less visible, causing bugs like bug 1506913.

This is the same bug that made Quantum lights break Tree Style Tabs, since Quantum Lights used accentcolor: white to change the tab line color.

I'm proposing to following steps to fix this problem:
- make the tab line color fallback to the textcolor, since textcolor is used for most of the browser window's textcolor by default, which will make theme authors more aware of the impact. This is also makes more sense as the tab line is a foreground item, and not a background item.
- Fix https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/6963
- Maybe run a mass migration for all themes incorrectly using accentcolor, the condition is pretty easy to check:

(does not have tab_line) && (has accentcolor) && (has headerURL)"

 ","[about:welcome] The right area overlaps the ""Thank you"" string on different locales at browser resize","[Notes]:

I have managed to reproduce the issue on RU and PL locales.
Probably the issue is reproducible in multiple languages where the ""Thank you"" string is displayed as one long word.
The issue is more visible on small screens.

[Affected versions]:

Firefox Nightly 101.0a1 (Build ID: 20220417212536)
Firefox Beta 100.0b7 (Build ID: 20220417185951)

[Affected Platforms]:

Mac 10.15.7
Windows 10 x64
Ubuntu 20.04 x64

[Prerequisites]:

Have the latest Firefox Nightly/Beta 100 PL build installed.
Have a new Firefox profile.

[Steps to reproduce]:

Open the Firefox browser with the profile from prerequisites.
Resize the browser ~40%.
Observe the ""Thank you"" message.

[Expected result]:

The ""Thank you"" message is responsive and is getting smaller while resizing the browser.

[Actual result]:

The right area overlaps the ""Tank you"" message while resizing the browser.

[Additional Notes]:

cleared with each page load. The throbber and the stop button pretty much go

Firefox is missing mozilla's ""bookmark this group of tabs"" function; it is not
present in the bookmarks menu, and not in the tab-bar right-click menu either.

This is a big miss since there is no way to bookmark a group other than creating
the group by hand and to manually drag and drop every tab to it.

This is a real pain, and mozilla has had this function for ages now.

One use for this is searching for pages on a given topic and wanting to save the
result as a group.

Another use for this is to save the currently open group of tabs before closing
FF, in order to restore it later on. for example to shutdown/reboot the PC, or
when installing a new FF build.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the bookmarks menu or right-click on the tabs-bar
Actual Results:  
Neither the bookmarks menu nor the tab-bar right-click menu has a ""bookmark this

When attempting to Save the CNN.com site to a file, on Windows, Firefox first warns that the file it is trying to download has too long of a name, and then it will crash.

Note that the name that appears in this ""name is too long"" dialog is *not* the name that was entered in the file picker.  The name in the File picker is: CNN.com - Breaking News, U.S., World, Weather, Entertainment & Video News.htm

But the name that appears in the dialog is far longer, you can see it in the screenshot in attachment 1 [details] [diff] [review].



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to www.cnn.com
2. Chose File->Save Page As
3. Do not change the default name in the file picker or location (I was saving to desktop since I had saved previous files there).
4. Click OK on the three spurious ""name is too long"" dialogs that pop up.
5. Firefox Crashes.
Actual Results:  
The download manager launches as the ""name is too long"" dialog appears.  The ""name is too long"" warning will pop up three times and then Firefox will crash.

A directory is created with the name suggested in the Filepicker and that directory contains the elements of the CNN site.  But, there is no CNN HTML page saved on the desktop.



Expected Results:  
The Site should be saved properly, with the suggested file name, no spurious error dialogs, and no crashes.

[Prerequisites]:

Have a new Firefox profile created.
Have the User.js saved in the profile folder before opening the profile. (Note there should only be 2 files in the folder, times.json and the user.js)
Have the Terminal opened.

[Steps to reproduce]:

Dag and drop the Firefox.exe in the terminal and add the ""--first-startup"" argument at the end.
Press the ""Enter"" key and select the new FIrefox profile created in prerquisties.
From the about:wlecome page click the ""Sign in"" hiperlink.
Observe the behavior.

[Expected results]:

The ""Sign in to Firefox Sync"" page is loaded.

[Actual results]:

Nothing happens.

[Notes]:

This issue is not reproducible when enrolled in the ""treatment-deafult"" branch,.
This issue is not reproducible on the latest Nigntly 83.0a1 build with the deafult behavior.
No errors are displayed in the browser console when clicking the ""Sign in"" link. Only the following message: ""AboutWelcomeParent: Received content event: AWPage:TELEMETRY_EVENT AboutWelcomeParent.jsm:173"".
Unfortunatelly I didn't managed to enrolled in the experiment on Nightly 83.0a1. However, probably the issue will also reporduce on these builds.

Build ID: 20171114221957

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to https://sourceforge.net/auth/do_login and save a password. (You don't have to save a correct password, that is, for this experiment, you can use random username and password.)
2. Visit https://urceforge.net/KVB7JRQ4GPSH5QUEPZGU37SR3A/ .
3. Hell, the site has changed a login form, so the password is not filled. Let's copy it from saved passwords. Go to ??耳쩱e Information?? go to ???쨇urity?? click ???톏w Saved Passwords??and copy the password.
4. Paste the password to the login form.


Actual results:

At step 3., password for a completely different site (i.e., https://sourceforge.net) was shown as a password saved for https://urceforge.net. This caused me to paste my password for https://sourceforge.net to a fraud site.

(Well, https://urceforge.net is not actually a fraud site, just my demo. It is intentionally on a private URL only.)


Expected results:

At step 3, Firefox should not have shown the password for https://sourceforge.net . Firefox should apply the same same-origin policy as on password filling.

Other variants of the attack include using http website where https should have been used. This makes such attack more powerful in local network, especially with http links in e-mail due to link trackers.

Severity estimate: This issue allows password leak with some considerable (but still plausible) user interaction. I believe this is either sec-high or sec-moderate.

When you have multiple tabs opened in Mozilla Minefield 4.0b10pre and you completely close the browser you never get asked if you want to save your session.  It just completely closes itself out.  So then when you open the browser again. It starts a whole brand new session so you have to back track and find the sites you previously visited.  Now if you open more then one tab and accidentally delete a tab you can restore that tab provided its in the same session and you don't close out the browser.  Please fix this problem...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open more then 1 tab and go to 2 different sites on each of the tabs.  It don't matter what site you go to.
2.Click the X in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  You will not get asked if you want to save your session.
3.Open the browser back up and the tabs you had opened up are gone.  your session was not saved.
Actual Results:  
My session was not saved when I had multiple tabs opened and it went straight to my home page with 1 tab with a new session instead of opening my same session back up with the same tabs so I could finish where I left off being I had multiple tabs opened up.

Expected Results:  
If I have multiple tabs opened up  and I click the X in the upper right hand corner of the screen to close out the whole browser it is supposed to let me know that I have more then 1 tab opened up and ask me if I want to save my session.  That it did not do...

63 is introducing a new ""content blocking"" mode that takes the place of tracking protection and demotes it to a category of content blocking. This will be behind a pref for now, which means the UI has to be able to fit both for the old TP content as well as the new Content Blocking.

The main change for the identity popup is the introduction of a list of content blockers as well as slightly updated tracking descriptions.

The ""reload to apply changes"" code also needs to get a little smarter (we can't just look at blocked-content and a single pref anymore) and show a text-link instead of changing the button behavior now.

If the content blocking UI pref is off, we need to:

- Change the header to ""Tracking Protection""

 ","Search aliases: @engine text should remain in the urlbar when highlighting search suggestion results, and modified suggestions should search with the @ engine","See bug 1496814 comment #6 (copied below).  Bruce points out two main problems:

(1) When you type ""@engine query"" and then highlight a search suggestion result, the text in the urlbar changes to ""query suggestion"", but we should keep the @engine text: ""@engine query suggestion"".

(2) When you type ""@engine query"", highlight a search suggestion result, modify it by continuing to type, and then press the enter key, we do a search using the default engine, but we should search using the @ engine.

(2) seems more like an obvious problem than (1) to me.  But (1) probably follows from (2).  i.e., if it's ambiguous in (2) which engine will be used, then showing @engine in the text would make it clear.

Verdi, any thoughts?

(There's a third problem below of the one-off header being wrong, but I'd like to focus this bug on the main interaction.)

What this test is doing is quite simple:
https://hg.mozilla.org/try/rev/1ca1b2ddb66807ce6d7b86367d8e3ff1c35984af#l3.20

It is opening a new window and loading a few tabs in it.  If you look at the screenshot <https://taskcluster-artifacts.net/KMsDrB9MTtiC63yvDVfkbQ/0/public/test_info/mozilla-test-fail-screenshot_eunnfw.png> you will note that this is happening quite early in the startup, before we have even had time to put the window completely on the screen.

After some time looking around at the code, here is my hypothesis as to what is happening.

Note that the test is running in --verify mode here.  So the browser is starting up, and right away we're starting to run the test.  This needs to happen very fast, before browser.xul in the second window fully initializes.

As the test is running, the browser finishes its initialization, and sessionstore-windows-restored gets dispatched.  That triggers this callback, which is running in response to the *main* browser session initializing!  This is the root of our call stack.  Then we end up initializing a bunch of lazy-inited stuff until we get to this code: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f997bd6bbfc4773e774fdb6cd010142370d186f9/browser/components/newtab/lib/ASRouterTriggerListeners.jsm#43>

I don't know what this code exactly depends on running, but I think the main thing that it is being confused on is which window has just been initialized.  As a result we go ahead and access win.gBrowser, but this happens before <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f997bd6bbfc4773e774fdb6cd010142370d186f9/browser/base/content/browser.js#1334> has run, so we end up with an intermittent failure.

Note that this can bite any test which ends up opening a window shortly after the browser startup.  A quick search on Bugzilla shows 14 intermittent bugs on file about this issue.  I believe fixing this can fix them all in one go, so I'm setting up dependencies."

Build Identifier: 

The most common actions I take in my browser are:

* search with google
* go to location bar, type in an address or nickname
* paste in an address by middle-clicking on the window
* click on a link
* go back (especially when doing google searches)
* reload (especially for nicknamed or bookmarked pages)
* copy address and paste into another app

All of these should have keyboard shortcuts. And they do. 

But back and reload are very simple actions that should have single key shortcuts. 

Currently on Unix the shortcuts are awkward to find with the fingers: Alt-Left
and Ctrl-R. 

They should be the same as on Windows: Backspace and F5. If that's not possible,
other keys should be found so that only a single, easy-to-find-with-the-fingers,
key needs to be pressed for these extremely common actions.

Thanks for your work on free software.

However, we should do some verification work to ensure that is still working, and at a minimum update the comment in the code.

"Toolbars and Customization
 ",The new Privacy Preferences Pane misfires an <enter> keypress into a check box,"The new privacy preference panel (bug 462041) introduces an odd error in keyboard navigation that has some serious consequences for testing and disability access.

Essentially what happens is that an <enter> keypress is fired at a checkbox instead of selecting the option from a <menulist> control.  That has serious implications because the checkbox that gets checked in this case is ""Always start Firefox in Private Browsing Mode"", which has deep implications for test infrastructure and session state.

= STR **Follow these steps exactly** =
1. Open a Shiretoko (anything later than Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090416 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre)
2. Open the Preferences panel
3. Use the Mouse to clisk on the ""Privacy"" icon
4. Use the Tab key to focus the historyMode <menulist> dropdown
5. Use the Down Cursor (arrow) key to select the ""Use Custom Settings for History"" option
6. Hit Enter with the ""Custom settings"" option selected

= Expected =
That should simply bring up the deck containing the detailed custom history settings *the same way it would if you'd used the mouse to make that selection*

= Actual =
The enter keystroke in step 6 somehow selects the ""Always start in private browsing mode"" keystroke which immediately throws you into PB mode.  

If you reset the preferences window to the way it was and re-run the steps using nothing but the mouse as your selection mechanism, you will see that when you select ""Use Custom history settings"" from the drop down you are presented with an entirely different list of defaults and the ""Always start in private browsing mode"" is unchecked in that list of defaults.

Also happens in Linux, except you do not need to hit the <enter> key in step 6 on linux: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090416 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre

= How does this affect testing =
If you have any state listeners using sockets, those sockets are destroyed upon entry into PB mode. We use a socket mechanism to allow jsbridge to remote control a mozmill test running in ""automatic"" mode.  That's how we originally found this bug, in fact, the mozmill test stopped working.  I don't think this would affect a mochitest run.

= How does this affect A11y =
Many A11y uses use the keyboard exclusively for navigation. So, that path needs to work the same way as using a mouse to navigate through the software.

I'm going into such great detail here because I'm going to ask for blocking because of the last two points.  I really think this is a basic navigational bug and ought to be fixed before we ship 3.5."

 ",Improve the way Firefox determines that an account is verified,"Firefox currently polls the server to determine whether the user's account is verified.  Bug 1018022 slightly improved the polling from a UX perspective, but there's still room for improvement, and bug 1122443 points out that Firefox hits the server too much.

We should improve the way that Firefox determines whether the user is verified, from the perspectives of both UX and server load.

Some things to keep in mind:

* 15-20% of signups are never verified (bug 1018022 comment 4).

* We poll for 20 minutes, but of course the user may verify after that.

* When requesting verification status we always poll, but maybe it makes more sense to poll only when we recently asked the user to verify, and other times simply check once with the server.  e.g., so that we don't continually poll if it's been a month since we asked the user to verify.

* Persist the last time we polled so that poll logic can be smarter by spanning Firefox sessions?

* For users who haven't verified after a long time, remove their account from the browser so we stop checking verification status altogether?

* Use push or long polling instead of polling?"

Steps to reproduce:

This was originally recommended in the HTTP 1.1. spec:

   15.1.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Accept Headers
   User agents which offer the option to configure the contents of an
   Accept-Language header to be sent in every request are strongly
   encouraged to let the configuration process include a message which
   makes the user aware of the loss of privacy involved.

The current version of the spec states:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231
   5.3.5. Accept-Language
   It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send
   an Accept-Language header field with the complete linguistic
   preferences of the user in every request (Section 9.7).
   [...]
   User agents ought to provide guidance to users when setting
   a preference, since users are rarely familiar with the details of

"Tabbed Browser
 ",Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.,"It is possible to install an arbitrary XPI without user's consent if the user holds Enter on a malicious website containing a specially crafted JavaScript code.

There are 2 layers of protection against an unauthorized installation of extensions:

1) The principal of the opener is checked against whitelisted domains that are allowed to download the plugin without asking. If the domain is not trusted, the user is asked to allow to download the plugin.
2) When the plugin is downloaded, the user is asked to confirm the installation.

The first protection can be circumvented by creating a hidden ""Embed"" element containing an arbitrary XPI as its ""pluginspage"" parameter. The attacker can focus this element while the user holds Enter, causing a number of ""Plugin Finder Service"" windows to appear. The first window focuses the ""Cancel"" button and will just close, but all the subsequent ones will set focus on the ""Manual Install"" button directing to the malicious XPI. As soon as the user releases the key, the browser will start launching multiple windows with the provided URL. The windows will have a ChromeWindow object as their opener, so the user will not be asked to allow to download a plugin.

The second protection can be bypassed due to a logic error in amWebInstallListener.js. When no window-watcher is registered in Services, this will throw:

Services.ww.openWindow(this.window, ""chrome://mozapps/content/xpinstall/xpinstallConfirm.xul"",null, ""chrome,modal,centerscreen"", args);

with the following message in the console:

Warning: WARN addons.manager: InstallListener threw exception when calling onDownloadEnded: TypeError: Services.ww is undefined
Source File: resource://gre/components/amWebInstallListener.js
Line: 170

When the confirmation dialog fails to open, the installation will commence as though the user clicked ""Install"".

Getting the browser into a state in which Services.ww is permanently undefined can be achieved with no user interaction by using a modified version of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616659 on a signed website. Exploiting it locally will likely bring about corrupt windows and a lot of errors in the console, but Services.ww will be defined. On a remote signed website, with the try-catch-inside-eval recursion performed during page load, after an alert dialog which prevents ""too much recursion"" error from occuring, it fails silently and Services.ww remains undefined for the whole browsing session, ie. Firefox will not ask to confirm a plugin installation until the user restarts the browser. The only mitigating factor is that if Services.ww was defined earlier in the browser session, the exploit may fail and corrupt windows will appear (hence point #2 in the steps described below, after opening windows to import the certificate). This was noticed by Zach Hoffman in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616659#c37 but the implications there were reverse.

There may be other ways to wind up with Services.ww undefined, but those should be safe as long as the plugin installation is stopped when xpinstallConfirm.xul fails to open.

Reproducible: always (as long as Services.ww wasn't defined earlier in the browsing session)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Import x509.cert for software makers identification.
2. Close the browser and reopen after the process shuts down.
3. Open jar:http://x.x.x.x/mozilla/signed.jar!exploit.htm (see comment 1)
4. Press and hold enter.

Actual results:
The plugin is automatically downloaded and installed.

Expected results:
The plugin should neither be downloaded nor installed without user's consent.

* Last Sync: xx:xx when Sync is correctly configured (there is another bug to use a better time format, but that isn't what this bug is about)

* ""Sign in to Sync"" if Sync is not configured - the button correctly takes you to Sync prefs, but just has no tooltip.  (The hamburger area has no tooltip in this case - not clear if it should, but it is less important as the menu itself reflects the action that will be taken)

* ""Reconnect [email-address]"" if the user needs to re-authenticate (the hamburger area has this exact tooltip in this case.)  Currently the button does nothing in this case, but bug 1082428 will ensure we go to sync prefs.

"Preferences
 ","Photon API for adding, removing, and moving page actions","The functionality of both the screenshots and Pocket menu items live in extensions.  The screenshots extension at least would like to call into browser code to add its item, as opposed to the browser adding the item and calling into the extension, and ultimately that's the design we want for extensions anyway.  Also, the Photon spec calls for the ability to move items between the panel and the urlbar.

All of these things mean that we need to implement an API for adding and removing page actions and moving them between the panel and urlbar.  AFAICT there are two use cases: actions that are simply a typical menu item like screenshots (or more generally either a menu item or a menu with submenus/subviews and subitems, like the Send to Device menu?), and actions that are a menu that expands into an iframe shown in a subview, like Pocket.  So the API needs to support both cases.

The API I'm talking about is just a typical browser JSM.  I'm thinking of CustomizableUI.jsm.  I'm not talking about a WebExtension API.  I'm planning on updating Pocket to call into it just like it calls into CustomizableUI.  I'm less clear on screenshots right now."

Steps to reproduce:

We have a application that has an issue when we login to it for the first time using mozilla browser 31.4 . The request do not go from the browser to our server due to unknown reasons . But the moment we do a page refresh , everything starts working where our application is able to hit the server to fetch details and show in the user interface. Earlier we were using Mozilla version 24.8 and did not face such issues. To check we have done the downgrading of Mozilla version from 31.4 to version 24.8 and our Application responded beautifully without any issues . But moment i again upgraded back to 31.4 , we go the same issue back where Application doesnt load value since request does not pass from User INterface back to server. We have also tried with latest version of moziila currently available and see that issue still persists .


Actual results:

Mozilla version 31,4 onwards the UI is not reposnive and does not interact to backened server to load the page. Can we know the any reason for this in general ?


Expected results:

Our Application should have run the normal way where we do not face issue with other Browsers like Internet Explorer and Chrome . It only happens in Mozilla which is unfortunate and we are looking forward for your help .

Thank you in advance for understanding."

etc. The forms engine's tracker remains active during a Sync, meaning that as we apply incoming records we also increment the score and attempt Syncs. IIUC nothing really bad happens due to this other than extra work done during a Sync (making the browser slower than normal) and that at the end of the Sync we may be left with an elevated score causing the next Sync to run before it otherwise would have.

I think this is a simple fix - the tracker should be looking at this.ignoreAll."

Now, whenever I load firefox, it will load ONLY the minefield start page correctly. If I try to do any search in google, firefox crashes. If I try to go to ANY webpage - crash. 
If I use safe mode, it works properly.
I then uninstalled firefox and all personal settings. 
I re-installed it fresh with no addons and no user settings.

If I set a webpage other than minefield start page or blank, it will crash immediately when trying to load the homepage.

Data collection review

QUESTIONS:

Can we apply some sort of filter to make absolutely certain that the `domain` is only ever in a known list of possibilities? I have concerns about that aspect of the collection and would feel better if there was some sort of set-membership or even regex filter preventing accidental leakage.

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Events.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 80.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 1, Technical.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels, when enabled by Normandy.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes, pending answer to question.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :tdsmith is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 80.

Result: datareview+, pending :tdsmith's answer"

Say the textbox is focused.  As you press Tab/Down, you move the selection to the first list item and then down the list items, and then when you get to the last list item and hit Tab/Down again, you select the first one-off.  From there, you can press Left/Right to select another one-off.  When you press Tab/Down again, the selection wraps around to the top of the list.  Shift+Tab/Up work similarly but in reverse.

So we don't break people's Tab habits, but you can still Tab down to the one-offs.

It is never written to the server and isn't exposed on *our* client record. It steals from the engine.lastSync attribute after uploading other records.

After this nightly build is downloaded and installed, the Import Wizard
initiates and starts importing the favorites, saved passwords, history etc. 
The user is not provided any control over he import data. The Back and Cancel 
buttons are disabled and so the user cannot cancel the import.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download the latest nightly build from mozilla.org and start installation.
2.When the installation is finished, check off ""Launch Firefox"" and click ""Finish""
3.Manually launch the browser

Actual Results:  
After the browser is installed, the Import Wizard automatically starts importing
the favorites, cookies etc from the installed browsers on he system. The user
has no control of stopping this import of data.
Also when the import is complete, the next dialog box disappears in a couple of
seconds not allowing the user to even manually click the ""Finish"" button.


Expected Results:  
The installer should ask for user input whether to import data from other
browsers, rather than taking over the control.

Follow up tests
---------------
1. Replicated three times and the same misbehavior is seen. The last window,
signalling the finish of import, disappears in a few seconds, making it almost
worthless to have it displayed in the first place.


Importance of the Bug
---------------------
1. The installer takes control of importing the data from other browsers,
whereas the user might not want certain data to be imported to this browser.

2. Also the buttons provided in the Import Wizard are disabled, so even if the
user changed his mind mid way of the import, he cannot diable the import."

 ",[Protections Panel] Telemetry and data review,"Comment on attachment 9086045 [details]
request.md

PRELIMINARY NOTES:
The Review Request says the collection is for all release channels, but the Events.yaml definitions specify `releaseChannelCollection: opt-in` which means it will only be collected on 'nightly' and 'beta' channels. I will assume you wish to collect this on all channels and will change the definitions to `opt-out` before landing the change.

DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

    Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so is documented in its definitions file [Events.yaml](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/toolkit/components/telemetry/Events.yaml) and the [Probe Dictionary](https://telemetry.mozilla.org/probe-dictionary/).

    Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

Yes. This collection is Telemetry so can be controlled through Firefox's Preferences.

    If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

No. This collection will expire in Firefox 75.

    Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

Category 2, Interaction.

    Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on for all channels.

    Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers?

No.

    Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Yes.

    Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

Yes. :nhnt11 is responsible for renewing or removing the collection before it expires in Firefox 75.

If it has been more than some period of time since the recipe was successfully evaluated, experiments should end, as this long term failure may represent an incompatibility or a failure of infrastructure that makes the experiment unsafe.

I have a PDF which renders correctly in various versions of Adobe Reader but which contains text that is displayed upside-down and backwards when viewed using pdf.js.  I have not attached the PDF as it contains some personal information but I would be willing to provide those necessary for the purposes of fixing the bug.

To further clarify, by ""upside-down and backwards"" I mean that the individual glyphs are rendered upside-down and then the entire text run is rendered as if it were a rtl run even though it should be ltr."

Dietrich writes:

We certainly do need to worry about this. I've had the backup/restore
on my radar for a while, just haven't been able to get to it. once the
menu UI lands (today), i'm planning on moving on to this.

we currently only import/export the bookmarks root. which means
that the unfiled root and tag root are not being backed up at all,
atm. this is an untenable position.

ideally we could use JSON serialization for this. however, i'm a bit
worried about perf, as we haven't tested large-scale JSON
import/export vs bookmarks HTML format. first thing i'll do is
probably run some tests against large collections to get some ballpark
numbers for this."

 ",Firefox doesn't prompt to become default browser (for first profile created after installing),"Latest 54.0a1 to 51.0b1, likely also before. Windows 8.1 64-bit

The first profile created after installing Firefox doesn't prompt for setting it as the default browser.

Steps to reproduce (Nightly and Developer Edition will prompt on second launch, browser on first, release likely similar, but I haven't tested):
1. Installed Nightly into the old custom install directory (but any custom install directory should work).
2. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
3. Create a new profile.
4. Launch the profile.
5. Close the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual result: Not prompted to set it as default browser.
8. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
9. Create a new profile.
10. Launch the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual & Expected result: Prompted to set it as default browser.

The first profile which won't show the prompt has browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser automatically set to the custom value false.

This gets sets at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/components/shell/ShellService.jsm#52-74 because DefaultBrowserOptOut in the registry is True and gets deleted, so it won't get set for profiles created later.

The code for setting the registry key is at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi#1025"

Try to read parameters using getParameter(""file1"") with a parameter tag like so:

results in a null pointer being returned only in Mozilla browsers.

This is very critical as NONE of my applets work with Mozilla browsers since 
they all use <param> tags!

 ",Use a lock with a strikethrough for HTTP pages that have Password Fields in the Control Center,"HTTP websites have no business asking for passwords.  The passwords can be intercepted by man-in-the-middle attackers and eavesdroppers.  Given that password reuse is very prevalent, when an HTTP website asks for a password, it is compromising the users security on its site and any other site where the user shares the same password.

When we detect that an HTTP page has a password field, we should show a grey lock with a strike through instead of the grey globe.  If the user clicks the grey globe we can add text to the Control Center.

This is somewhat related to bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=748193 but not exactly.  bug 748193 is about adding a doorhanger.  This bug changing the existing globe icon without popping anything up to the user automatically.

This also moves us a step further in the HTTP deprecation plan https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/"

Affected platforms

macOS 10.15
macOS 10.13

Steps to reproduce

Enable the Bookmark Toolbars
Add several New Separators (right-click on the toolbar bookmarks)

Expected result

The separators are clear, the contrast is strong

Actual result

The separators are barely visible

Regression range

The first one, reflects the state until the contrast was good, but not necessary when it started to be bad, the bad build shows no separator at all


First bad:  f6c3a0a19d82db25750d8badccd5cf37e79d028e (2018-04-11)
Last good: da809ecceaf3a8ada0aa2d7115822d39d0439654 (2018-04-12)

The second regression range solved the separator being invisible, but the contrast of the separator became an issue that could be now  observed visually


First bad:  47e81ea1ef10189ef210867934bf36e14cf223dc (2018-05-23)

3. Open some tabs.
4. Open downloads window from Tools > Downloads
5. Close the browser window (so only the download window remains open)
6. Whilst the download window is still open, relaunch firefox

Expected:
Firefox window starts up with previous session's tabs present

Actual:
Firefox starts up, but not with the session-you-just-closed's tabs

I guess this is because when you shut down the last browser window but with the downloads window still active, firefox doesn't consider this to be closing firefox down, so no session data is saved.

Perhaps instead of firefox saving session date only when the firefox.exe process is closing, it should do it when the last browser window is closing?"

So I'll remove the dependency on bug 1607797 and add one on bug 1608597. afaict in my testing, we can actually enable tips on nightly now.
I also want to mention that we could also solve this bug by modifying the muxer so that it prefers the tips provider over the top sites provider when both are present. (Thanks to Marco for that insight.) That's effectively the same as the priority system created in bug 1608597, just another way of doing it that doesn't depend on figuring out bug 1607797.

This uses waitForNewWindow - seems reasonable to just make the helper do the waiting, assuming that doesn't break stuff.

Try push with a fix to see if unrelated stuff fails:

https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=eb74e36e627ab9b3e197cd335843ab405e761de9


The breakage in the test when removing about:blank stuff otherwise ( https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=6fe4dffa507f64d3f8e51ed7f11f1c2ad0505158&selectedJob=206120788 ) is effectively caused by the deactivation/blurring of the original window calling 'rollup' for all open popups, which breaks opening the popup (if it happens between popupshowing and popupshown).

This is effectively pretty much the same as bug 1499234 except for waitForNewWindow instead of openNewBrowserWindow.

(And yes, perhaps we should unify these 2 things somehow, making openNewBrowserWindow rely on waitForNewWindow, but I'd rather not try to do that in this bug as there may be unrelated fallout)."

 ",Add support for limited hard-coded localizations to Pocket,"The in-product Pocket code is currently shipping hard-coded en-US strings, outside of the usual localizable places. We'd like to extend this to include Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and German. Also outside of the normal L10N flow, since this is an exceptional/special situation with a short timeframe.

Specifically, we currently have:

  browser/base/content/browser-pocket.dtd
  browser/base/content/browser-pocket.properties
  browser/components/pocket/panels/js/dictionary.js

(Note that these are not under the usual /browser/locales/en-US/... tree.)

The short-tem fix here, as I understand it, will be to do the following:

1) Add browser-pocket-$LOCALE.properties files for ru/jp/es/de.

2) Add run-time detection (similar to the browser.pocket.useLocaleList check in CustomizableWidgets.jsm) to pick the correct .properties file to use.

3) Figure out a solution for doing effectively the same thing for the .dtd strings. I suspect it will be easiest to move these strings to the .properties files, and do runtime DOM manipulation to jam them into the right places (menuitem labels in the context menu / bookmarks menu).

4) The dictionary.js file comes from Pocket, but we probably need to suggest how to use the solution in #2 here so they can do the same.

After a system crash caused by another program firefox wouldn't start anymore. When attempting to start firefox the entire system would stall. First other programs cannot be started anymore, then a few seconds later running programs would start to not react anymore until the entire system freezes and a hard-reset is the only option.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
Actual Results:  
System freezes.

Expected Results:  
Firefox start

Facts:
I run a Vista 64 SP 1 with all recommended updates except the Silverlight update.
I had no problems running firefox before the system crash. I did not change any relevant system configuration or updated firefox in between the last successfull running of firefox and the system crash. I cannot recall if firefox was running during the system crash, but it's very possible. The system crash was propably not due to firefox (I was running a game when my system blue-screened on me; I was not able to recognize the error code), but it may have been.
Reinstalling firefox without removing the user data would not fix the problem.
Purging firefox (including user data) before reinstalling it fixed the problem though. Firefox runs fine now again.
I cannot reproduce the failure now anymore.

Speculation:
The crash left firefox (more precise its user data) in a state that would cause the entire system to malfunction when firefox was started.
Sadly I did not backup the firefox user data before purging it, so I cannot provide the propably corrup data for inspection."

* All platforms are expected to use the same autofill provider/JSON storage module (no platform-specific database implementations)
* We'll want conflict resolution to prevent autofill data from being clobbered across devices, thus the guid/mtime fields for each entry.
* The UI will want to know the recency of entries to determine order for the autofill list, thus the lastUsed fields for each entry.
* We want to prevent unnecessary syncing of unchanged data, thus the mtime field for the top-level address/payment containers. Any mtime updates to children will bubble to the parent.
* We'll need a way to keep track of deleted data. Similar to existing synced DBs, Nick suggested using a tombstone object with a ""deleted"" property to keep track of deletions.
* Since we don't want Sync to be dependent on Gecko to access/modify the JSON database, we'll need to use a file locking mechanism to prevent concurrent reads/writes."

 ","Locking the ""sanitize on shutdown"" pref causes sanitization to happen at every startup, breaking pages opened through the command line","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20100101

Steps to reproduce:

The setting `lockPref(""privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown"", true);` in my mozilla.cfg is used (this is the only setting). Launch Firefox in the command line, opening the Twitter homepage: `firefox twitter.com`.


Actual results:

Firefox is launched, but the Twitter homepage is not opened.


Expected results:

The Twitter homepage should have opened.

The culprit is confirmed by me and several people on Reddit to be the setting `privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown`--when it's set to true, many (but not all, apparently) URLs cannot be opened if they are specified as arguments to Firefox when launching it from the command line. Simply setting it to false or commenting it out will restore the expected behavior."

 ","On preference experiment expiration, app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.* is not removed","[Description:]
Once a client gets enrolled into a preference experiment, Normandy creates a preference: app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.experiment_preference_name and stores the experiment temporary value in it in order for it to be available in early start-up. 

This is mainly due to the fact that the preference experiment are still remote actions and not local actions.

In a normal behavior, the app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.experiment_preference_name should be removed once the experiment expires.

[Affected versions]:
Release 63.0    
Beta 64.0b3 2018-10-22 
Nightly 65 2018-10-26




[Affected platforms]:
- most likely all, tested on Windows 10/ Windows 8.1

[Pre-conditions:]
user_pref(""security.content.signature.root_hash"", ""DB:74:CE:58:E4:F9:D0:9E:E0:42:36:BE:6C:C5:C4:F6:6A:E7:74:7D:C0:21:42:7A:03:BC:2F:57:0C:8B:9B:90"");
user_pref(""app.normandy.api_url"", ""https://normandy.stage.mozaws.net/api/v1"");
user_pref(""app.normandy.dev_mode"", true);
user_pref(""app.normandy.logging.level"", 0);


[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Create/Publish a pref-experiment that sets an existent int preference.
2. Run a firefox client with the pre-conditions.
3. From delivery console disable the pref-experiment
4. Restart the client. 
5. Restart the client.

[Actual Result:]

2. Pref-experiment is applied to the client.
4. Upon restart, pref-experiment expires and the value for the preference is set to the initial default value.
app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.experiment_preference_name is not removed.
5. Upon the 2nd restart, the value for the preference that has been involved into the preference experiment is now re-set to the experiment value, due to the fact that app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.experiment_preference_name was not removed.

[Expected Result:]
The expected result is that upon experiment expiration, the experimental value is reset to initial value and the app.normandy.startupExperimentPrefs.experiment_preference_name is removed.

[Regression Range:]
Since for Normandy regression ranges, mozregression is not usable, a manual regression range was attempted and we managed to reduce the regression range to this:

last good build: 63.0a1 (2018-07-14)
first bad build: 63.0a1 (2018-07-15)

https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?startdate=105+days+ago&enddate=103+days+ago

The most likely candidate from the above pushlog to introduce this regression in my oppinion might be bug 1471025.

[User Impact:]
This bug causes users that have been involved into a preference experiment to have the experimental value set again after the first restart after the experiment has expired."

Very high memory, normally 150mb, now it's at least 300mb-1GB maximum. Abnormally high CPU usage, causes lagging in typing and flash applications. This happens in particular after watching flash videos with enabled hardware rendering. I had a lot of tabs open, but firefox used to maintain a 150-200MB memory use mark. I assume that the flash task/thread/ or application isn't removed from memory. My memory is rising at the moment. 670MB's at the moment, with 8%-30% of cpu usage on a Core 2 Duo. When I restart, it usually functions normally again.

If high enough memory takes place, firefox runs out of resources to store images, and sometimes crashes when memory is bad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Work with any flash application/ or watch a video (preferably in hardware rendering which is what I tested.

2. Stop watching/ or close the tabs.

3. High CPU Usage and memory takes place.
Actual Results:  
High CPU Usage and memory takes place.

Expected Results:  
While watching the flash video, high CPU usage is expected, partly due to the fact of hardware rendering. But memory should have not gotten higher than 300MB's. When the flash application was terminated, it should have stopped using resources.

 ",Autofill search engines when they can't be filled by normal origin autofill,"Certain engines won't be autofilled because their common name doesn't match their search url. For example ""en.wikipedia.org"" will be autofilled if the user types ""en."" but not if the user types ""wiki"".
For these engines, we used to have an attribute named resultDomain, that was used to autofill when browser.urlbar.autoFill.searchEngines was set. This feature was never enabled though, also because there was some risk to practically ""book"" all the letters if the user has quite a few engines (""w"" would immediately autofill to wikipedia).
We should find a better long term solution. We could for instance rename resultDomain to something more understandable, and we may not necessarily need it to be an origin, it could also just be a common name like ""wikipedia"" for en.wikipedia.org.
And we should probably also use autofill to check if the localized name would be autofilled.
We should likely do this special engine autofill only for those that have this special attribute, and then remove the old browser.urlbar.autoFill.searchEngines feature that never made to release.

Then I continued to use the profile for ~24 hours until the Linux kernel killed it because the machine was out of memory, presumably due to other reasons.

Then I noticed that my profile was gone, and was very sad. But I thought I might be able to check my other computer for any ""synced tabs"". A lot of them are there, but some are definitely missing. In particular, all the tabs I had open to plan my imminent trip to Hawaii are gone. I believe, although I cannot prove it, that the tabs that were synced were the ones that had been ""refreshed"" since the previous crash, and that tabs which had been restored but hadn't been ""refreshed"" are totally gone.

It's possible that my specific use case is unique due to actually deleting a profile rather than merely keeping a bunch of tabs around, but I thought I would open a bug anyhow."

However, it seems that it's not caused by the Flash plugin itself. The same works on Google Chrome with the same Flash plugin version and I managed to reproduce this bug on other platforms (Windows, Linux 32bit) with Flash Plugin 10.1.85.3 as well.

System is Fedora 13, 64bit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://maps.google.com/
2. zoom into an area where Street View is available
3. place the Street View marker on a Street where Street View is available; Street View is not being accessed
4. move Street View marker to another spot where Street View is available
Actual Results:

 ",Reconciling doesn't work correctly after duplicate detected,"philikon and I think we found a bug in the reconciler.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Set up 2 profiles with the same entity but different IDs, let's call them profiles A and B and the record IDs X and Y.
2) Make a change on record Y in profile B 
3) Perform sync on profile B
4) Delete record X in profile A
5) Perform sync on A

In A, the tracker has X marked as a changed ID. And, the engine has _findDupe() implemented. During sync, Y arrives on A. Let's follow along in Engine._reconcile():

1) item.id does not exist in _modified b/c X != Y
2) store.itemExists(Y) is false because X != Y and X is deleted anyway.
3) Incoming record isn't deleted, so step 2.5 passes
4) In the _findDupe(), we finally detect that X and Y refer to the same entity. The local ID, X, is preferred over the incoming one, Y.
5) The incoming record's ID is changed from Y to X.
6) _reconcile() returns true, telling the engine to apply the record
7) The incoming record with ID X eventually makes its way to store.applyIncoming()
8) store.applyIncoming() calls store.itemExists(X), which returns true because the store knows about the deleted record.
9) store.update() is called. This makes no sense because the local record X was deleted and update() makes no sense.

The underlying problem is that dupe detection occurs at the end of reconcile and handling duplication assumes that we just want to figure out which ID to take and do nothing more. The fact that there could be actual changes to reconcile on duplication is ignored!

I believe the solution is to effectively re-process/reconcile the record with its new ID after duplication."

Build ID: 20151014143721

Steps to reproduce:

Hello,

i would prefer to use PDF.JS instead of Adobe Reader, but there are some major problem - this is the reason why wo don't use PDF.JS in our company.

1) We often use ""scaling"" in the printing preview when printing a website, because a lot of website are not optimized for printing. the scaling factor is often changed.
The problem is that this ""scaling"" (e.g. 80%) is also be used for PDF at the moment.
But this what normally nobody wants. Everybody want to get the pdf 1:1.
Scaling for PDF and Webpages should be ""seperated"".

2) when printing with 100% scale the PDF is moved some millimeters to right (firefox is adding margins!).
Firefox does also add a second BLANK page the the printjob. I thinks this is because the ""image"" of the page has been ""moved"" because of the margins.
I think this issue is also described in other bugreports (but without any details)

3) it is possible to download a file. But a button for directly attach the pdf-file to a new email for sending is also missing.

i hope i can support you fixing this issues

Data review for spoc shim

This bug adds the shim (id) that was approved by legal in bug 1550119 to a few more existing new tab actions (save/dismiss), so the review is essentially the same. Going to escalate to legal for the same reasons (potential category 3 data and 3rd-party collection tool) but expect it should be fast approval.

1) Is there or will there be documentation that describes the schema for the ultimate data set available publicly, complete and accurate?

Data Dictionary: https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/258b3ad76d5284c87ef209d9b2c5aaddfffc8113/docs/v2-system-addon/data_dictionary.md


2) Is there a control mechanism that allows the user to turn the data collection on and off?

The user can opt-out the data collection by either disabling the telemetry of Activity Stream or disabling the Firefox telemetry as a whole. You could also opt out of sponsored content, and it would no longer send any pings related to sponsored content, including the shim. Also if you turned off Activity Stream or Discovery Stream, it would also opt out.


3) If the request is for permanent data collection, is there someone who will monitor the data over time?

The Pocket ad ops team (Lillian Bui) and analytics (Kirill Demtchouk) will monitor this data over time.


4) Using the category system of data types on the Mozilla wiki, what collection type of data do the requested measurements fall under?

This could be considered either Category 2 or Category 3 data. It is data about the interactions with the Firefox new tab page, but the save/dismiss do imply interactions with content (and thus maybe web activity).


5) Is the data collection request for default-on or default-off?

Default on.


6) Does the instrumentation include the addition of any new identifiers (whether anonymous or otherwise; e.g., username, random IDs, etc. See the appendix for more details)?

Yes, save and dismiss events will now include a ""shim"", which is a base64 encoded id unique to the impression from the Ad server. This id has already been approved for impression/click events.


7) Is the data collection covered by the existing Firefox privacy notice?

Unsure.


8) Does there need to be a check-in in the future to determine whether to renew the data?

No, this is a technical requirement of the Ad server to work. It needs it to properly serve sponsored content and must be continued as long as the ad server is used.


9) Does the data collection use a third-party collection tool?

Yes, AdZerk will generate the shim, and receive it in anonymized save and dismiss events."

In this case we simply use the reference little earlier.

After further investigation, we found out that there is a difference between the bucket name from the add-on source code and the bucket name from the ""Remote Settings Server"". More exactly the add-on targets the ""cfr-ml-model"" bucket collection but on the server, the bucket collection is named ""cfr-ml-models"".

[Affected versions]:

[Affected Platforms]:

Windows 10 x64
Mac 10.15.2
Ubuntu 18.04 x64

[Prerequisites]:

Have the environment set to ""Stage"" using the latest version of the ""Remote Settings Devtools"" add-on from here.
Have a Firefox profile with the following preferences set in the ""about:config"" page:

""extensions.messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1.test.scoringBehaviorOverride"" pref set to ""random_between_1_and_9999""
""xpinstall.signatures.required"" set to ""false""
""xpinstall.signatures.dev-root"" set to ""true""


You are enrolled on the ""treatment"" branch of the experiment.
Have the latest version of the ""messaging-system-personalization-experiment-1-addon-treatment@mozilla.org-1.0.0-signed-testing"" add-on installed from here.

[Steps to reproduce]:

Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites.
Wait for ~2 minutes and navigate to the ""about:config"" page.
Observe the value of the ""browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.scores"" pref.
Observe the value of the ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.providers.cfr"" pef.

[Expected result]:
3. The ""browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.scores"" is set to a value between 1 and 9999.

The ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.providers.cfr"" has the following attributes:

bucket: ""cfr-ml-experiments""
cohort: ""PERSONALIZATION_EXPERIMENT_1_TREATMENT""
personalized: true
personalizedModelVersion: ""X"" where X can be any string.



[Actual result]:
3. The ""browser.messaging-system.personalized-cfr.scores"" has no value at all.

The ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.asrouter.providers.cfr"" pref DOES NOT contain a cohort, personalized, or personalizedModelVersion attribute, however, the pref contains only the ""cfr"" bucket value.

[Additional Notes]:

This issue is not reproducible on the ""control"" branch of the experiment.

All windows of a session are restored in the same virtual desktop although originally they were in different desktop. (it seems that the restore data do not keep information about windows in which virtual desktop were in).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox windows in several desktop
2. shut down Ubuntu
3. start firefox
4. select restore session 
Actual Results:  
All session windows pop up in same desktop windows 

Expected Results:  
Windows should appear in the previous desktop they were in


(it may be that this bug is somewhat related to #339445)

Although this is not a blocking bug, I believe it is a true inconvenient. Beside unexpected crashes (which are few), the restore session is useful not to bookmark pages (those that are of temporary interest) and still be able to get them back after shutting down or restarting the system. When using the restore session in that way, one may have opened 20 firefox windows spread over 4 desktops. Having to finish the restore by putting the windows back in their virtual desktop, is minor but still a pain."

Steps to reproduce:

Have created a web site ""weseeco.org/courses"" that contains FTP files created in Abode Acrobat. The site contains several files with the ability to navigate between files and within each file the ability to go to various pages (IF one presses the button to go to page 5 one goes to page 5. If one wants to return to the TOC page clicking on that TOC button takes on back to the index). On Explorer and on Chrome all the navigation works well.


Actual results:

On Firefox the navigation between files works just fine.  But within a file (kinetics or stoch) if one clicks page five one goes to page 4, ie clicking on page n takes you to page n-1. Clicking on the TOC buttons take you to the page above the index page again n-1. So in Firefox but not in Explorer or Chrome the paging is off by one page! So something strange must be happening with the Firefox indexing.


Expected results:

I would think that the Firefox brouser should work in the same way as the other two. Suspect that there is an indexing command in Firefox that is wrong.

You can access the web site ""weseeco.org/courses"" and see for yourself. Note (1) on the router page only the kinetics and stoch buttons are presently active. (2) In the kinetics and stoch modules only the buttons on the bottom of  the blue title page take you back to the router. The index with all of the page buttons is placed on the second screen.

If the gold star is selected a second time, a dialog comes up which contains a field for the bookmark name, a drop down to select the folder the bookmark goes in, and a field for tags.

By default, when this dialog comes up, the folder dropdown is pre-selected with ""All Bookmarks"" as the containing folder. Two of the other options if the dropdown is selected are the Bookmarks Menu and the Bookmarks Toolbar. If either of these are selected and the dialog is dismissed by clicking on ""done"", the ""All Bookmarks"" option will never appear again when the dialog is opened in the future. This seems like a bug of some sort (either we should never see ""All Bookmarks"" or it should consistently be there).

After downloading source code of both Release and ESR builds I noticed that the guids of nsIDOMHTMLInputElement.idl are different:
- ESR: e59a4df5-0904-414d-9203-9af2790698ea
- RELEASE: 83984fd0-b0b2-11e1-afa6-0800200c9a66

The difference is due to a change which fixed Bug 809865 ( https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809865 ).

It seems that the XUL code that the release version of Firefox 17 was built with is different (and older) than the code that the ESR version was built with (and after a little bit of checking it seems to be older than what Beta6 has been built with as well).


Expected results:

My native extension should have worked in Release version as well.

The release version should be built with the new XUL code and a new build should be released as soon as possible."

* it observes that an engine sync is complete, but checks |subject| for the name of the engine - the engine name is sent in |data|.

* The inline ""onComplete"" function is called such that |this| in the function is not the correct object when called bu the nextTick() function.

* The |force| param to |buildList()| was setup to specify whether a new Sync should be forced or not - but if this param was false, it still didn't actually rebuild the list using the most recently available data.

 ","Allow rapid experimentation with appropriate features, cohorts, telemetry, etc.","We want to be able to experiment with a large number (~10/week?) of potential new tab / pocket designs to figure out which lead to better engagement with low overhead and trusted results.

For example, we probably want to try multiple layouts at the same time to minimize the effects of stories differing each day.

One idea is to adjust the server endpoint for various cohorts of users for an ongoing study that allows the server to adjust the layout at whatever rate without needing additional experimentation signoff.

To be able to differentiate the multiple experiments for a given cohort, we'll want to make sure our telemetry can differentiate them, which probably involves just sending back some experiment id.

Reader View is currently triggered on sites like YouTube and Pinterest which are very popular sites which many users might browse quite soon after installing Firefox which greatly increases the chance of the tour not being successful.

I understand we trigger the tour on the first page that is detected as potential article. As this detection has many false positives we should consider additional measures to increase the chance of this tour being shown on an actual article.

 ",Insert tabs' linkedBrowser lazily into the document,"Support bug for bug 906076.

As we begin to actually implement lazy-browser strategy, we will need to modify the code which is presently accustomed to dealing with tab.linkedBrowser, to work with lazy-browser tabs.  

However we need a fallback so if any consumers out there try to access linkedBrowser properties on a lazy-browser tab, things won't break.  This would be especially true for addons which have not yet adjusted to the lazy-browser strategy.

This bug creates a proxy for linkedBrowser which, if the tab is still in its lazy-browser state, will instantiate the browser if linkedBrowser properties are accessed.

Note that we use a proxy rather than a simple getter for linkedBrowser, because in some cases we can return some properties based on prior knowledge of the tab, and avoid linking the browser before we want to.

Note that in this bug, we are only setting up the proxy implementation, and in practice we still will not be experiencing the optimizations of lazy-browser linking, as the proxy will nearly immediately force the browser to be linked by code accessing linkedBrowser in SessionRestore.  In later incarnations of lazy-browser tabs, we will be training SessionRestore to deal with lazy-browser tabs."

Bug 332748 made me think of filing this bug. There may be several usability issues with the ""Older than 6 days"" folder:
1. it looks weird to have one folder per day, then one folder for 174 days.
2. expanding it takes a long time (bug 385245)
3. it contains thousands of entries so it's nearly useless to scroll down in the hope to find /the/ page you visited x months ago.

It'd be cool if history folders were dynamically created on the basis of browser.history_expire_days, or if a, say, 3-month timeframe was used:

"Private Browsing
 ",Create new sync telemetry ping type.,"We want to submit custom telemetry data for Sync health. This bug is for the client side work of this effort and encompasses defining the first cut of a json schema for the data, then collecting this data and submitting it as a new ping type. I'll open further bugs (so the pipeline ops team knows about the new ping type, and for redshift processing etc) once we have general agreement on the direction.

I believe the back-end processing of this ping data will expect to validate the data against the defined schema - so I think we also need to perform this validation as part of client-side tests to have any hope of getting it right - bug 1249925 tracks that in general so I'm having that bug block this.

I'm attaching a proposed JSON Schema for this work. At a high-level, each ping will include an array of ""syncs"", where each element is the info for a single sync - so no data is rolled-up between Syncs (ie, there's no concept like ""count of successful syncs"" - just an array of syncs, each one of which may have success or failure information). Each ""sync"" record has its own ""engines"" array, which lists information about every engine that synced. The expectation is that the reduction of these records into summary information will be done at the back-end.

In later bugs we will look to extend this schema into collecting further ""health"" related stats, but this bug is just to get the ball rolling with a relatively minimal set of data for our initial dashboards.

An example of this data is below. It shows a ping containing a single sync that started at the timestamp 12345467, took 560ms, was done on behalf of the Sync user with UID ""abcdefg"", has no failure (ie, it succeeded), and only Synced one engine, ""bookmarks"". The bookmarks engine took 500ms to sync, saw 100 incoming records, but only applied 50 of them, and 50 of them failed with 5 of them being new failures in this sync. It also attempted to upload 100 records, but the server reported 3 of them failed:

{     
  syncs: [{
    when: 12345467,
    took: 560,
    uid: ""abcdefg"",
    failureReason: null,
    engines: [{
      name: ""bookmarks"",
      took: 500,
      incoming: {
        considered: 100,
        applied: 50,
        failed: 50,
        failedNew: 5,
      },
      outgoing: [{
        sent: 100,
        failed: 3,
      }],
    }]
  }],
}

Note that the attached schema is more JS than JSON - it has comments, doesn't include quotes around all property names, has trailing commas, etc. From my experiments some validators allow this while others do not. Allowing comments seems particularly useful - but ultimately this will probably depend on exactly what validator we choose to use in the front-end (which I assume itself depends on what is used on the back-end?). This schema is valid according to http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/

Georg, does this all look like it is the correct direction to take here? Does the schema look reasonable and looks like something we can start working from? (the schema is a WIP and requires further fleshing out, but it should convey the idea)"

 ",Firefox saves wrong window restore size while closing a maximized window.,"Firefox saves wrong window restore size and window position while closing a maximized window.

Current logic is making restore window button useless. Which is too irritating.

This was tested on windows.

Steps:-
1. Exit Firefox, to close all Firefox instance.
2. Re-Start Firefox, to get a single Firefox window.
3. Re-Size window to 60% size of screen display.
4. Reposition window 10% away from top and left.
6. Exit Firefox, then Re-Start Firefox.
7. You can see Firefox remember window state, 
   size and position correctly.
   (ie, restore state, size 60%, 10% from top/left) 
6. Now Maximize window, by clicking window maximize button.
   (remember not to change position/size
     when it is still in restore state)
7. Exit Firefox, then Re-Start Firefox.
8. You can see Firefox in Maximized window state,
   ie, Firefox remember window state correctly.
9. Now click Restore Button. 

Result:-
--------
  You can see 
  * size is almost 100% of screen size
  * position almost left, top of screen size

Expected:-
---------
  * size 60% of screen size
  * position at 10% from top/left of screen.



What to be done:-
---------------
We should use following common logic.

function onExitApplication(){
  switch(window.state){

    'maxmized' : 
       save_window_state('maxmized');
       break;

    'normal' :   /*ie, restored state*/

       save_window_size(window.width, window.height);
       save_window_position(window.left, window.top);
       break;

    'minimized' : 
    'systray' : 
    default :
        /*save nothing*/

Yesterday on IRC we discussed about the case where a user may copy something, make changes, then paste. That's an edge case that may prevent us from just storing the info on copy.

I was wondering if we could do something clever like prefetch the DNS connection for the result set in the awesomebar as a way of making the:

 - type in awesomebar
 - select entry

sequence of events much quicker.

I imagine that we'll need to do it only once we've gotten some stability on the result set, but we can probably pick a close enough heuristic for that and start there."

 ","Store the uid as the login manager ""username"" instead of the email address for Firefox 44","In bug 1157529 we landed support for the FxA code to handle the user's uid being used as the login manager ""username"" to better support changing email addresses for users. However, that bug did not actually write the uid, as that would cause breakage if those users used Nightly (and thus had the uid written) then used Release (which would not recognize the uid). So once that bug hits the release channel we should start writing the uid and rely on the fact that all current versions of Firefox will happily read the uid.

We expect bug 1157529 to hit release with Firefox 41, so we should land this patch while Firefox 44 is on nightly (meaning 41 will then be release)"

Ed and I spent a bunch of time poking at this yesterday.  What's happening here is that enqueueEarlyMessageMiddleware keeps its queue as part of the redux store, and we're trying to send a message to telemetry from ComponentPerfTimer.render() that render was reached without actually having the data to do the render (i.e. .initialized was not set).

Now we are doing something that makes render not be a pure function, and the sending could (and perhaps should) be moved to componentDidUpdate to avoid that.  That said, the code is guarded so that it can't actually send more than once, so it isn't really a problem, though it may be a bit fragile.

However, Ed also realized that since the queue is part of the redux state, changing it is presumably causing a re-render, which is effectively irrelevant, since _this_ particular bit of state isn't used at all in determining _what_ gets rendered.  Whether this has a measurable performance cost is unclear, but it is happening at startup, when we're quite sensitive about this sort of thing (although, to be fair, we're seeing the warning in debug mode, so that _could_ be a red herring).

At the very least, we should make the warning go away, and maybe the re-rendering is also important (and fixing that by not using the store for the queue would make the warning go away).

Kate, what are your thoughts here?"

ACTUAL RESULTS:
My first tab ends up at Bugzilla, but my second tab ends up at my Yahoo search-results page!!! (despite the fact that it was NOT what was focused when I hit enter)

I suspect the issue here is that we pull the Bugzilla-bookmark out of the awesomebar suggestions, as soon as that tab loads, and we replace it with a ""switch to tab"" entry.  (but there's some race condition, so that doesn't actually happen visually)  And so when I hit Enter on the Bugzilla-bookmark, the awesomebar ends up dropping me to the next entry, which happens to be this Yahoo search results page.

Screencast coming up, showing this bug in all its annoying glory. :-/  I run into this several times per week -- often several times per day. (Not usually with the exact ""open two tabs back to back"" STR that I outlined here -- that just happens to be an easy way to trigger this.)"

Specifically, I used the regexp:

So, stuff needs to be removed from files that don't end in .jsm.

The simple form also needs to be removed when it starts with whitespace. I was having problems with that, but the version of my patch that I was using was broken so maybe it will actually work now.

Firefox3 Beta crashes when I try to print to PDF or to any connected printer. I tried other sites and have no problem printing but don't know if it is a broken page because I have same problem at all post pages (not the main page) and cannot reproduce in stable releases of firefox.

Error Console report:
$ is not defined

This line is highligted
$('q').addEvent('focus', function() {



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Beta Version is installed on Ubuntu 8.04 AMD64 server Beta with gnome and ubuntu-desktop installed.
2.Open browser and go to http:ubuntuforums.org 
3.Go to the absolute beginners section and select any post.
4.File>print> choose PDF file generator or any connected printer and select <print>
5.Follow same steps with several other posts. No problem with other sites other than very slow to close when finished printing.
Actual Results:  
Firefox closed
When I restart and restore session, the above error report has been logged.

Expected Results:  
It should have successfully sent the print job to print device

Everything on system is fresh install, with default settings.
It is however a Beta browser installed on a 64 bit Beta OS"

 ","[e10s] Link with target=""_blank""  to download a file leaves a about:blank window/tab open after the download","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160823121617

Steps to reproduce:

With 48.0.2 click a link, for example to a PDF file or .JNLP file, that has target=""_blank"" set and PDF attachments set to open automatically and it will open a new tab (or window depending on the browser.link.open_newwindow option) and then open in the PDF client but that tab/window will remain open. In the past that tab/window would instantly closed.

Setting browser.link.open_newwindow to 1 so it forces use of the current tab is a workaround but may cause unexpected issues with other links.

This isn't consistent behavior however as we have ~250 users (Windows 7 32-bit and 64-bit) and it's not happening to everyone but it only started when they upgraded to 48.0.8.


Actual results:

The tab/window for the file that downloads and opens wasn't closed


Expected results:

The tab/window for the file that downloads and opens should've closed"

In bug 245765, the Preferences menu entry moved to the Edit menu again for
XP_UNIX, but not for XP_MACOSX and also Windows. Because of this, Firefox users
cannot find Preferences on the same spot for all the supported OS.

That's *EXTREMELY* bad, because one of the MOST important pros of Firefox (and
Mozilla) is that it is cross-platform and thus should AS MUCH as possible behave
the same everywhere. 

With the introduced change, it no longer does.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Start Ff on Windows, Linux, MacOS X and try to find the Preferences menu entry.
Actual Results:  
On Linux, it is under Edit. On all the other OS, it is is still under Tools.

Expected Results:  
According to bug 245765, GNOME HIG dictates that Preferences has to be under
Edit. Because of that, the other OS have to follow.

Or GNOME HIG should not be followed, and Preferences should be under Tools
again. Either way is fine - it just *HAS* to be consistent.



Because it makes Firefox harder to use, I'm setting severity to Major."

I expect most people with worse screens or more sight problems than me (and I'm not the best sighted person in the world!) won't see any feedback at all.
Dark is in a better shape regarding Secondary contrast, how you can see on the Figma colors palette.
Amy, is there anything we can do about this? Would it be possible to tweak Light secondary a bit to increase visible feedback? (thus increase contrast against white)

I will not delve into this addon, I see that the problem goes beyond.
I believe that many addons such as these will arise, my suggestion to mitigate the problem at hand is to create a verification tool addons, example:
Firefox addons trust.
1 - Implement the police for developing addons, where developers will have to send upload addon for Mozilla Firefox which will ensure that the addon does not contain codes that endanger the security of Firefox users.
2 - After ensuring the Mozilla Foundation code generates an MD5 or SHA1 rash on the file of the addon, this will be the signature trust Firefox addons.
3 - When a user decides to install a Mozilla Firefox addons, Firefox addon that causes the rash that is being installed and check the online subscription base of Firefox addons trust.
4 - If the rash of this addon is on the basis of trust Firefox addons installation is released indicating that the addon is safe.
5 - If the rash of this addon is not on the basis of trust Firefox addons installation is blocked indicating that the addon is not safe. ""If you are sure you want to proceed will endanger their privacy. ""

obs. The signature verification is fast and lightweight, it only gives the existence of the rash that has a size of few bytes.

 ",About dialog weirdness,"I found a cool new way to screw things up in phoenix.

1. Choose Help/About (a dialog box appears, well done)
2. Click on the link in the dialog (copyright etc)

The weirdness begins: it opens a new phoenix window with the about: info but the
window doesn't appear in the task bar. The window seems fully operational, I'm
able to click on links and write new addresses in the url bar.

Now, let's shake things up some more:

1. Open a new window (just to see it doesn't appear in the task bar either)
2. Press ctrl-f (find dialog appears, dismiss with esc)
3. Press ctrl-f again

Find dialog doesn't work any more. Manage bookmarks works every other time.
About doesn't work.

After closing some windows (they minimize in a weird Windows 3.1-like manner,
btw) you can see that the about dialog is still blocking the first window.
Clicking ok makes things normal again: newly opened windows appear in the task
bar and the find dialog etc. work."

 ",Make hot-path APIs fast,"In v8 of Normandy (what is currently deployed), we optimize the ""hot-path"" views (the ones that each get hit about ~5 times/second). This is done by making sure that none of these views make DB queries (when the cache is hot). There are tests that verify this.

The new hot-path doesn't use the optimized views, and goes through a couple DRF views. We can cache these in a similar way so that they don't make DB queries. We should add tests to verify this.

This bug covers:

1) Figure out what the hot path is now
2) Add tests that assert the hot path doesn't make any DB calls with a hot cache
3) Make the tests pass

For reference, here is a test that asserts a view doesn't make any DB queries: https://github.com/mozilla/normandy/blob/04f61576d14b55bcbc7a8a5e12a7a8ec6656fcc8/normandy/recipes/tests/test_api.py#L335-L351

The top-sites collection also contains the non-experiment version of Amazon for the US, DE and GB locales and eBay for DE and GB.
This seems to cause them to be displayed after the user has dismissed the experiment versions. This could be considered ignoring user choice.

[Affected versions]:

Firefox Beta 83 (Build ID: 20201112153044)

[Affected Platforms]:

Windows
Linux
macOS

[Prerequisites]:

Have Firefox Beta 83 installed and open.
Be enrolled in a treatment branch of the ???셮Sites Launch Phase 3??experiment:

Use the Stage environment.
browser.partnerlink.useAttributionURL set to true
browser.topsites.experiment.ebay-2020-1 set to true
browser.search.experiment set to amazondotcom-adm
browser.topsites.useRemoteSetting set to true



[Steps to reproduce]:

Open a new tab.
Dismiss the Amazon Sponsored tile.
Observe the Top Sites displayed.

[Proposed result]:

A non-sponsored Amazon top tile is not displayed after the user has dismissed its Sponsored version.

[Current result]:

A non-sponsored Amazon top tile is displayed after the user has dismissed its Sponsored version.

[Additional Notes]:

The behavior decribed in the steps can not be reproduced for eBay on the US version of the experiment.

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

The feature ""use small icons"" in toolbar customization is both ambiguous and
obsolete, and does not take into consideration smaller status-bar icon sizes and
the customization of individual toolbar sizes.

There exists 4 standard icon sizes used in Firefox.  48x48, 32x32, 20x20 and
16x16.  48x48 are the default toolbar button sizes, 32x32 are the ""use small
icons"" sizes, 20x20 is found in throbber and status-bar icon sizes, and 16x16
are found in the menu-bar, url-control, search-control, tab-bar, and sometimes
in the status-bar.  Currently, there is no way to define 20x20 and 16x16 when
customizing a toolbar.

I propose to describe these sizes as ""Large"", ""Standard"", ""Small"" and ""Tiny""
respectively.  Noting that Large is the default size and Standard is the size
used by ""use small icons"".

Including 20x20 ""Small"" and 16x16 ""Tiny"" would set a standard with Theme makers
to include these sizes with their themes.  This would allow more icons to fit in
the menu-bar and status-bar, and would allow for even smaller toolbars for those
of us with huge monitors and good eye sight.  I know the difference between
20x20 and 16x16 is insignificant, but these are still standard sizes that should
be supported less we kill 20x20 in favor of 16x16.

Additionally, the ability to specify individual toolbar sizes should be added as
a standard feature in Firefox.  The ability to drag toolbar icons into ANY
toolbar (including menu-bar, tab-bar and status-bar) should also be added. These
features are currently available through Toolbar Enhancements.

Thank you for your consideration.

Mozilla Firebird is the default.

Hi,

There are two bugs I found (I think) :

1. When installing two themes at near concurrent times.. (from the site.. 
   the javascript instruction to install the themes) the first one is 
   stopped... and I have to uninstall it.  

2. When I apply a theme the current page vanishes. Refresh doesn't work. I
   have to restart FireFox.




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to themes
2. Go to themes again (new instance/window)
3. Click both (the second just a few sec. after the first)
4. View the themes window.
5. After any has finished downloading, apply it. 


Actual Results:  
After 5, The current page is gone.. refresh dosn't work.
The first theme was stopped.. need to uninstall it

Expected Results:  
After 5, the theme is applied, and the page is still there.. refresh should work.
the first theme must have been kept going.. or the second theme queued for
downloading."

I have disabled Flash in the Plug-ins so not sure if this message has to do with the crash or with the fact that Flash is disabled.

But every time I've tried to restore this saved session from the other Mac, Firefox has crashed after about a minute or two.

At first, I had tried to merge the session from the other Mac with the current session and it also crashed after a while and also it would create another set of windows (two more in this case) that were duplicates of the already existing windows, not the windows/tabs from the other Mac session, but it still crashes.

So tried to just load the other session without merging and Firefox still crashes. 

The other Mac is running MAC OS X 10.5.8 and the crashing Mac is running Mac OS X 10.6.5 if that matters, but both are running Beta 4 build 7 and the other Mac has not crashed with the session I'm trying to load.

I'm not sure what else to try.

-Bob


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load session from other Mac that I copied over to this Mac
2. wait a little while and it crashes - every thing appears to be happening as
expected up until the crash - by that I mean other URL's are loaded, the screens look correct with the correct app tabs and groups and then it crashes with the above error. One odd thing is that when the crash window apperas the URL listed under ""Details"" is not the youtube site but a site on apple.com (can't recall exact site and its now gone after the restart). I will try and do the load session again after I save/create this bug so I don't loose all this effort...
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Open other session (two windows and 91 tabs and about 7-8 groups)"

"Bookmarks & History
 ",Items created between the first sync after creating an account and the browser shutting down are not synced.,"From https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/issues/6226

STR:

1) Start a fresh profile in Nightly
2) Go to preferences, and sign in to sync by creating a new Firefox Account
3) When prompted, save the login for accounts.firefox.com
4) Visit some other websites (e.g. reddit.com) and generate saved logins on those sites as well
5) Connect another device to sync using the same Firefox Account

Expected results:

All the saved logins from steps (3) and (4) are synced to the new device.

Actual results:

Only the login from (3) is synced, additional saved logins are not.

-----

From looking in about:sync-log and using the about:sync addon, it appears that Desktop does not upload the saved logins generated in step (4).  It does successfully upload the one saved in step (3), possibly because that gets saved moments before sync is enabled in the browser.

If I continue browsing after step (5) and add more saved logins on desktop, those too will not be uploaded.  If I quit and restart Firefox, then any new saved logins will be successfully synced, but the ones from (4) will not.

If I sign out on Desktop and sign back in, then it will successfully upload all of the saved logins.

All of which sounds like there's some issue with the logins change-tracker after signing in with a new account on Desktop."
